## **What Title IV Means for You**

### **Real affordability --- not fine print**

(Plain-English explainer for the Healthcare Affordability and Cost Protection Act)

## **The short version (2 minutes)**

Title IV puts hard limits on how much healthcare can cost you.

Not estimates.

Not "average" costs.

Not promises.

Real caps. Enforced by law.

It protects you from:

- runaway deductibles,

- surprise bills,

- medical debt,

- and "insurance" you can't actually afford to use.

## **The problem this fixes**

Right now, many people are "insured" but still can't afford care.

That's because:

- premiums are only part of the cost,

- deductibles can be thousands of dollars,

- bills are unpredictable,

- and costs reset every year.

The system tells you:

> "You're covered."

Your bank account says otherwise.

## **What Title IV changes --- clearly and directly**

Title IV creates three lines of defense for your finances.

## **1ï¸âƒ£ Your monthly premium is capped**

Under Title IV:

- your premium is limited based on what you earn,

- the rules are the same everywhere,

- and small income changes don't suddenly make coverage unaffordable.

No more:

- premium spikes you didn't see coming,

- losing help because you earned a little more,

- choosing between insurance and rent.

Your premium becomes a predictable bill, not a gamble.

## **2ï¸âƒ£ There is a real yearly maximum --- no tricks**

Today, "out-of-pocket max" often doesn't mean what it sounds like.

Under Title IV:

- everything counts toward the cap\
  \
  (deductibles, copays, coinsurance)

- insurers can't move costs outside the cap

- once you hit it, you stop paying

That's it.

No exceptions.

No fine print.

If you get seriously sick, there is a hard stop on how much it can cost you.

## **3ï¸âƒ£ Care is affordable when you need it --- not later**

People delay care because:

- they can't afford the visit today,

- they don't know what it will cost,

- they fear a surprise bill.

Title IV fixes that by:

- making preventive care low- or no-cost,

- keeping copays predictable,

- protecting mental health, maternity, and chronic care,

- banning hidden or retroactive charges.

Healthcare works when you can actually use it.

## **What this means in real life**

### **If you're healthy**

- You don't avoid checkups to save money.

- You catch problems early.

- You pay less over time.

### **If you have a chronic condition**

- You don't ration medication or visits.

- You don't restart treatment every January.

- You can budget for care without fear.

### **If something serious happens**

- You know the worst-case cost.

- You don't lose your home or savings.

- You focus on getting better --- not fighting bills.

## **What insurers are no longer allowed to do**

Title IV stops insurers from:

- calling plans "affordable" while shifting costs later,

- using high deductibles to scare people away from care,

- designing plans that look cheap but hurt when used,

- delaying care to save money.

Affordability must be real, not rhetorical.

## **Does this raise taxes?**

No.

Title IV is paid for by:

- cutting waste,

- lowering prices,

- stopping insurer games,

- and reducing emergency care caused by delayed treatment.

When people can afford care:

- the system spends less,

- not more.

## **Why this matters even if you think you're covered**

Most medical debt comes from people who had insurance.

Title IV fixes that.

It makes insurance mean what people think it means:

> protection.

## **The bottom line**

Title IV does something simple and overdue:

> It puts a ceiling on how much sickness can cost your life.

No family should go bankrupt because someone got sick.

This law makes that protection permanent.
