## **What Title VI Means for You**

### **Less paperwork, lower costs, and care that actually flows**

(Plain-English explainer for the Healthcare Administrative Simplification and Efficiency Act)

## **The short version (2 minutes)**

Title VI cuts the red tape that:

- drives up healthcare costs,

- wastes doctors' time,

- causes coverage loss,

- and burns out healthcare workers.

It lowers costs without cutting care by fixing the machinery behind the scenes.

If you've ever lost coverage because of a form, waited weeks because of billing issues, or felt like no one could explain your bill --- this is for you.

## **The problem this fixes**

Healthcare in America is buried in paperwork.

That paperwork:

- doesn't make care better,

- doesn't make it safer,

- and doesn't make it cheaper.

It just makes it harder.

People experience:

- losing insurance over technical mistakes,

- re-submitting the same information again and again,

- delayed care because paperwork isn't "complete,"

- bills no one can explain,

- doctors spending more time clicking than caring.

This isn't accidental.

> Complexity is expensive --- and someone is always paying for it.

That someone is you.

## **What Title VI changes --- in real terms**

Title VI strips out administrative waste across the system.

## **1ï¸âƒ£ It makes enrollment simple and stable**

Right now, people lose coverage because:

- income changed slightly,

- paperwork was delayed,

- systems didn't talk to each other.

Title VI fixes that by:

- using existing data instead of endless forms,

- allowing enrollment through multiple programs,

- preventing coverage loss over minor issues,

- creating continuous coverage instead of churn.

If you qualify, you stay covered.

## **2ï¸âƒ£ It standardizes billing so bills make sense**

Today, healthcare billing is a maze.

Title VI requires:

- standard billing formats,

- clear explanations of charges,

- faster claim decisions,

- penalties for unjustified delays.

That means:

- fewer surprise bills,

- fewer "this isn't covered" letters,

- and less time fighting billing departments.

## **3ï¸âƒ£ It cuts pointless prior authorization**

Some prior authorization exists for safety.

Most exists to slow things down.

Title VI:

- automates routine approvals,

- allows authorizations to follow you if coverage changes,

- limits re-approval for ongoing care,

- blocks delays caused by administrative inefficiency.

If care is medically appropriate, paperwork can't stand in the way.

## **4ï¸âƒ£ It helps small practices and rural providers survive**

Paperwork hurts everyone --- but it hurts small and rural providers the most.

Title VI:

- simplifies participation rules,

- reduces reporting requirements,

- offers technical help for transitions,

- levels the playing field with large systems.

This keeps local clinics and hospitals open.

## **5ï¸âƒ£ It modernizes technology without locking anyone in**

Healthcare IT is outdated, expensive, and fragmented.

Title VI:

- requires systems to talk to each other,

- prevents vendor lock-in,

- improves data sharing safely,

- reduces manual re-entry.

That saves time, money, and frustration.

## **How this lowers costs for everyone**

Administrative waste is one of the largest hidden drivers of healthcare spending.

When paperwork is reduced:

- providers spend less on overhead,

- insurers spend less on processing,

- patients face fewer delays,

- coverage loss drops,

- and emergency care decreases.

Less waste = lower costs --- without cutting benefits.

## **What this means for healthcare workers**

Doctors, nurses, and staff didn't enter healthcare to fill out forms.

Title VI:

- cuts non-clinical work,

- speeds payment,

- reduces burnout,

- improves retention,

- and lets clinicians focus on patients.

Care improves when caregivers aren't buried in bureaucracy.

## **Does this affect your care choices?**

No.

Title VI:

- does not limit services,

- does not restrict providers,

- does not ration care.

It removes friction --- not options.

## **The bottom line**

Title VI does something rare in healthcare reform:

> It lowers costs by making the system work better --- not by making care harder to get.

Less paperwork.

Less confusion.

Less burnout.

More care.
