# **Title IX --- Oversight, Enforcement, and Accountability**

(Making reform real, measurable, and permanent)

## **SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Healthcare Oversight and Accountability Act."

## **SEC. 902. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.**

### **(a) Purpose**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  ensure full compliance with all provisions of this Act;

2.  establish clear lines of responsibility and enforcement;

3.  protect consumers, providers, and communities from abuse;

4.  ensure transparency in system performance and outcomes;

5.  prevent erosion of protections through neglect, under-enforcement, or delay.

### **(b) Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- healthcare reforms often fail due to weak enforcement rather than flawed design;

- existing consumer protections are inconsistently applied;

- lack of transparency undermines accountability;

- meaningful reform requires automatic, not discretionary, enforcement;

- public trust depends on visible consequences for abuse.

## **SEC. 903. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HEALTHCARE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION.**

### **(a) Establishment**

There is established within the Department of Health and Human Services an independent entity to be known as the Healthcare Oversight Commission ("the Commission").

### **(b) Composition**

The Commission shall be composed of:

1.  individuals with expertise in healthcare policy, administration, and economics;

2.  consumer protection and patient advocacy representatives;

3.  rural health and provider representatives;

4.  individuals with experience in enforcement and compliance.

Members shall be appointed by the Secretary, with safeguards to ensure independence and balance.

### **(c) Independence**

The Commission shall operate independently of regulated entities and may not include individuals with current financial ties to regulated insurers, PBMs, or providers.

## **SEC. 904. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.**

The Commission shall:

1.  monitor compliance with this Act across all titles;

2.  identify patterns of abuse, avoidance, or non-compliance;

3.  review enforcement actions taken by the Secretary;

4.  recommend corrective actions or regulatory changes;

5.  issue public reports on system performance and accountability.

## **SEC. 905. AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS.**

### **(a) Mandatory Enforcement**

Where violations of this Act are identified, the Secretary shall take enforcement action. Enforcement may not be waived or delayed without documented justification.

### **(b) Graduated Penalties**

Penalties for non-compliance shall escalate based on:

1.  severity of harm;

2.  duration of violation;

3.  repeat or systemic behavior;

4.  impact on affordability or access.

Penalties may include:

- civil monetary penalties;

- mandatory restitution;

- suspension or termination of program participation;

- corrective action plans under supervision.

## **SEC. 906. CONSUMER AND PROVIDER COMPLAINT PROCESS.**

### **(a) Complaint Access**

The Secretary shall establish accessible mechanisms for:

- consumers,

- providers,

- healthcare workers,\
  \
  to submit complaints regarding violations of this Act.

### **(b) Timely Review**

Complaints shall be:

1.  acknowledged within a defined timeframe;

2.  reviewed promptly;

3.  resolved with written explanation.

### **(c) Protection Against Retaliation**

Individuals submitting complaints shall be protected from retaliation, including:

- coverage termination;

- network exclusion;

- employment consequences.

## **SEC. 907. DATA COLLECTION, METRICS, AND PUBLIC REPORTING.**

### **(a) Required Metrics**

The Secretary shall collect and publish standardized data on:

1.  premiums and total cost of coverage;

2.  out-of-pocket spending by income and geography;

3.  denial and delay rates;

4.  prior authorization utilization;

5.  provider access and network adequacy;

6.  rural hospital stability and service availability;

7.  administrative cost trends.

### **(b) Public Dashboard**

Data shall be presented through a publicly accessible dashboard that is:

- updated regularly;

- presented in plain language;

- downloadable in machine-readable formats.

## **SEC. 908. PERIODIC REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT.**

### **(a) Regular Review**

The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, shall conduct a comprehensive review of this Act's performance at least every three years.

### **(b) Adjustments**

Based on findings, the Secretary may:

- recommend legislative updates to Congress;

- adjust regulatory parameters within statutory authority;

- strengthen enforcement priorities.

The goal of review is continuous improvement, not rollback.

## **SEC. 909. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) Protection**

Employees or contractors of regulated entities who disclose violations of this Act shall be protected from retaliation.

### **(b) Remedies**

Remedies may include:

- reinstatement;

- compensation for lost wages;

- civil penalties against retaliating entities.

## **SEC. 910. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND CITIZEN ENFORCEMENT.**

### **(a) Judicial Review**

Actions taken under this Act shall be subject to judicial review as provided by law.

### **(b) Citizen Enforcement**

Where systemic violations persist and administrative remedies fail, affected individuals or entities may seek judicial relief consistent with applicable law.

This provision is intended to complement --- not replace --- agency enforcement.

## **SEC. 911. FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATION.**

### **(a) Funding**

Activities under this title shall be funded through:

- existing enforcement budgets;

- penalties collected for violations;

- administrative savings generated under this Act.

### **(b) No New Taxes**

Nothing in this title authorizes new taxes or fees.

## **SEC. 912. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title IX matters**

This title ensures that:

- rules are enforced,

- abuse has consequences,

- transparency is routine,

- and reform survives political cycles.

Healthcare reform fails when enforcement is optional.

This makes it mandatory.

## **We now have a complete legislative package**

Titles III--IX together create:

- a new healthcare backbone,

- enforceable affordability,

- insurer accountability,

- administrative efficiency,

- drug cost control,

- federal--state coordination,

- and durable oversight.

This is no longer a concept.

It is a governing framework.
