# **ACA for the People**

## **Congressional Staff Brief (1 page)**

### **A practical healthcare overhaul that lowers costs, protects families, and stabilizes rural care --- without raising taxes**

## **What this is**

ACA for the People is a structural modernization of the Affordable Care Act that fixes what the ACA could not:

the power imbalance and cost drivers that keep healthcare unaffordable even for insured Americans.

It does not replace the ACA.

It repairs the foundation.

## **The problem we're solving**

Despite coverage expansion:

- premiums and deductibles continue to rise faster than wages

- insured Americans still face medical debt

- insurers retain control over plan design and access

- rural hospitals are closing at alarming rates

- administrative costs remain exceptionally high

- public subsidies often inflate prices rather than reduce them

Incremental subsidies and regulations have reached their limit.

## **The core solution: a healthcare backbone**

The proposal establishes a national healthcare backbone --- a universal baseline plan that:

- is available to all Americans

- sets enforceable affordability caps

- stabilizes coverage and provider payment

- disciplines prices through competition

- reduces administrative waste

- preserves private insurance as a supplemental or competing option

This shifts system design authority away from insurers and back to public rules.

## **What this delivers (policy outcomes)**

### **Affordability**

- income-based premium caps

- a true annual out-of-pocket maximum

- low or zero cost-sharing for essential care

### **Coverage stability**

- no coverage loss due to minor income changes or paperwork

- seamless transitions across programs

- national minimum protections regardless of state

### **Rural stabilization**

- access-based payment for rural hospitals

- predictable funding for emergency and maternity services

- reduced administrative burden for small providers

### **Cost control**

- insurer loophole closure

- administrative simplification

- drug rebate pass-through at point of sale

- elimination of spread pricing

## **What this does** 

## **not**

##  **do**

- âŒ No new taxes

- âŒ No single-payer mandate

- âŒ No elimination of private insurance

- âŒ No provider nationalization

- âŒ No overnight system replacement

This is structural reform, not ideological overhaul.

## **How this passes Congress**

The proposal is designed for modular passage, using:

1.  Must-pass vehicles for immediate affordability protections

2.  Targeted authorization for the backbone framework

3.  Existing regulatory authority for implementation details

Change is phased, minimizing disruption and political risk.

## **Budget & fiscal integrity**

The proposal is funded through:

- reduced administrative spending

- lower prices (which reduce subsidy outlays)

- elimination of rent extraction by insurers and middlemen

- improved coverage stability (less uncompensated care)

No new federal taxes, fees, or mandates are authorized.

## **Political viability**

Strong appeal to:

- rural districts

- small business owners

- healthcare workers

- budget-conscious members

- constituents facing high out-of-pocket costs

Opposition concentrated among:

- large insurance interests

- PBMs benefiting from opacity

Public-facing explainers and coalition materials are already built.

## **Why this is different**

Most proposals focus on:

- expanding subsidies, or

- regulating behavior, or

- ideological positioning

ACA for the People fixes structure.

It aligns incentives so affordability and access are automatic --- not constantly renegotiated.

## **Status**

This proposal includes:

- a full legislative blueprint (Titles III--IX)

- section-by-section bill language

- plain-English explainers for constituents

- a realistic implementation timeline

It is ready for:

- committee discussion

- staff review

- and coalition circulation

### **Bottom line**

ACA for the People lowers costs, protects families, and stabilizes care ---

by fixing the system itself.

It is serious reform for a serious problem.
