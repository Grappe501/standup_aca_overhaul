## **The Healthcare System --- Before vs After**

## **BEFORE: How healthcare works now**

### **(Fragmented, insurer-controlled, and expensive)**

### **How power flows today**

Patient â†’ Insurance Company â†’ Care (maybe)

1.  You get insurance (usually through work or the Marketplace)

2.  The insurer designs a complex plan

3.  Costs are split across premiums, deductibles, copays, coinsurance

4.  Care requires approvals, networks, and paperwork

5.  Delays and denials reduce utilization

6.  Providers fight billing systems

7.  Costs rise â†’ subsidies rise â†’ premiums rise again

### **What this system rewards**

- âŒ Complexity

- âŒ Delay and denial

- âŒ Cost shifting

- âŒ Market concentration

- âŒ Emergency care over prevention

- âŒ Administrative labor over patient care

### **What people experience**

- "I'm insured but can't afford to use it"

- "I don't know what this will cost"

- "My doctor says yes, my insurer says no"

- "My hospital is closing"

- "My premium went up again"

This system is not broken by accident.

It is working as designed --- for insurers.

## **AFTER: How healthcare works with ACA for the People**

### **(Structured, people-first, and affordable)**

### **How power flows after reform**

Patient â†’ Rules â†’ Care

1.  A national healthcare backbone sets the baseline

2.  Clear affordability caps limit what families can pay

3.  Coverage is stable and universal

4.  Providers are paid fairly and predictably

5.  Insurers compete on value --- not confusion

6.  Drug prices reflect real costs

7.  Administrative waste is removed

8.  Prices fall â†’ subsidies shrink â†’ costs stabilize

### **What this system rewards**

- âœ… Early and preventive care

- âœ… Simplicity and transparency

- âœ… Provider access and readiness

- âœ… Rural stability

- âœ… Honest competition

- âœ… Lower total costs

### **What people experience**

- "I know what I'll pay"

- "I can actually use my insurance"

- "Care decisions stay with my doctor"

- "My local hospital is still open"

- "Healthcare feels predictable"

## **Side-by-side comparison (simple)**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Today**                           **ACA for the People**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Insurers design the system          Public rules set the baseline

  Costs are unpredictable             Costs are capped and clear

  Coverage depends on job & ZIP       Coverage is universal

  Delay & denial are profitable       Delay & denial are penalized

  Drug discounts are hidden           Discounts go to patients

  Rural hospitals close               Rural care is stabilized

  Waste drives spending               Efficiency lowers spending
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## **The most important shift (in one sentence)**

> We stop subsidizing high prices and start enforcing low ones.

That's the difference.

## **Why this matters politically**

This is not:

- government takeover âŒ

- single-payer âŒ

- ideology âŒ

This is:

- system design âœ…

- affordability enforcement âœ…

- power rebalancing âœ…

That's why it can pass.

## **How to use this page**

- Pair it with the one-page overview

- Send it to skeptical lawmakers

- Use it in coalition briefings

- Turn it into a shareable graphic

- Anchor media interviews around it

This page makes the entire proposal click.

## **Where we are now**

You now have:

- the law

- the explainers

- the fiscal case

- and the system map

This is a complete reform package.
