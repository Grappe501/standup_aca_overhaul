# **Title VII --- Prescription Drug Pricing and Middlemen Reform**

(Lowering drug costs by fixing the supply chain, not rationing care)

## **SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act."

## **SEC. 702. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.**

### **(a) Purpose**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  lower prescription drug costs for patients and families;

2.  eliminate opaque pricing practices and middleman rent extraction;

3.  ensure savings flow directly to patients at the point of sale;

4.  increase transparency across the prescription drug supply chain;

5.  preserve access to medications while improving affordability.

### **(b) Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- prescription drug prices remain a major driver of household healthcare costs;

- price increases are often disconnected from manufacturing or research costs;

- pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) operate with limited transparency;

- rebate and spread pricing practices inflate list prices;

- savings negotiated on behalf of consumers frequently do not reach patients.

## **SEC. 703. POINT-OF-SALE PASS-THROUGH OF DISCOUNTS AND REBATES.**

### **(a) Pass-Through Requirement**

Any price concessions, rebates, or discounts negotiated with respect to prescription drugs shall be passed directly to the patient at the point of sale.

### **(b) Prohibition on Retention**

No entity may retain rebates or discounts for the purpose of:

1.  increasing margins;

2.  offsetting unrelated administrative costs;

3.  influencing formulary placement in a manner that increases patient cost.

### **(c) Enforcement**

Failure to pass through negotiated savings shall constitute a violation of this title.

## **SEC. 704. PROHIBITION ON SPREAD PRICING.**

### **(a) General Rule**

Entities administering prescription drug benefits may not engage in spread pricing, defined as charging a payer more for a drug than the amount reimbursed to the dispensing pharmacy.

### **(b) Required Pricing Model**

Drug benefit administrators shall operate under:

- transparent, fee-based compensation models; or

- other structures approved by the Secretary that do not incentivize price inflation.

## **SEC. 705. FORMULARY TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS.**

### **(a) Disclosure Requirements**

Entities managing drug formularies shall publicly disclose:

1.  criteria for formulary placement;

2.  the role of rebates or discounts in placement decisions;

3.  any financial relationships influencing formulary structure.

### **(b) Patient Cost Protection**

Formulary decisions may not be made primarily to:

- maximize rebates at the expense of higher patient out-of-pocket costs;

- steer patients to higher-priced alternatives without clinical justification.

## **SEC. 706. PRICE INCREASE JUSTIFICATION AND OVERSIGHT.**

### **(a) Disclosure of Price Increases**

Manufacturers shall disclose justification for price increases above a threshold determined by the Secretary, including:

1.  changes in manufacturing costs;

2.  research and development investments;

3.  market or supply disruptions.

### **(b) Public Reporting**

The Secretary shall publish reports identifying:

- drugs with significant price increases;

- trends in pricing behavior;

- impacts on patient affordability.

This section does not impose price controls but ensures accountability and visibility.

## **SEC. 707. GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR COMPETITION.**

### **(a) Promotion of Competition**

The Secretary shall take actions to:

1.  remove barriers to generic and biosimilar entry;

2.  prevent anti-competitive contracting practices;

3.  accelerate approval and adoption where clinically appropriate.

### **(b) Prohibition on Anti-Competitive Conduct**

It shall be unlawful to:

- delay competition through sham litigation;

- use contracting practices that exclude lower-cost alternatives;

- engage in pay-for-delay arrangements.

## **SEC. 708. PHARMACY ACCESS AND PROTECTION.**

### **(a) Fair Pharmacy Reimbursement**

Reimbursement rates shall:

- reflect actual acquisition and dispensing costs;

- be transparent and predictable;

- support independent and rural pharmacies.

### **(b) Prohibition on Retroactive Fees**

Retroactive pharmacy fees or clawbacks are prohibited.

## **SEC. 709. DATA REPORTING AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.**

### **(a) Supply Chain Transparency**

The Secretary shall collect and publish data on:

- drug pricing flows;

- rebate and discount structures;

- patient out-of-pocket trends.

### **(b) Consumer Access**

Information shall be made available in:

- plain language summaries;

- standardized formats;

- tools enabling cost comparison.

## **SEC. 710. FUNDING AND BUDGET IMPACT.**

### **(a) Cost Savings**

Savings generated through this title shall:

1.  reduce patient out-of-pocket spending;

2.  lower federal subsidy costs;

3.  support affordability protections under this Act.

### **(b) No New Taxes**

Nothing in this title authorizes new taxes, fees, or price controls.

## **SEC. 711. RULEMAKING AND EFFECTIVE DATES.**

### **(a) Rulemaking Authority**

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this title.

### **(b) Phased Implementation**

Implementation may be phased to:

- ensure compliance readiness;

- protect supply stability;

- prioritize high-cost drugs.

## **SEC. 712. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title VII matters**

This title:

- lowers drug costs where families feel them most,

- dismantles middleman profit games,

- restores trust in formularies,

- protects independent pharmacies,

- and delivers savings without rationing or taxes.

Drug affordability is not a mystery problem.

It is a structural one --- and structure can be fixed.
