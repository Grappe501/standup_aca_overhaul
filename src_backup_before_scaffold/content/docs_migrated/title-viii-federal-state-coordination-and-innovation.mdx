# **Title VIII --- Federal--State Coordination and Innovation**

(A strong national floor with room for better ideas)

## **SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Healthcare Federal--State Partnership and Innovation Act."

## **SEC. 802. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.**

### **(a) Purpose**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  establish a strong national floor for healthcare affordability, access, and protection;

2.  preserve and encourage state-level innovation that improves outcomes;

3.  prevent harmful fragmentation of coverage and consumer protections;

4.  coordinate federal and state responsibilities clearly and efficiently; and

5.  ensure that innovation serves people --- not loopholes.

### **(b) Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- states play a critical role in healthcare delivery and administration;

- variation without guardrails can undermine equity and affordability;

- existing waiver processes are often opaque and inconsistent;

- innovation should be encouraged when it improves access, affordability, and stability;

- federal standards are necessary to protect consumers nationwide.

## **SEC. 803. NATIONAL FLOOR FOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) Federal Minimum Standards**

Nothing in this Act shall permit any state to waive or weaken the following federal standards:

1.  affordability caps on premiums and out-of-pocket costs;

2.  universal availability of the Healthcare Backbone Plan;

3.  essential health benefits and coverage standards;

4.  protections against discriminatory plan design;

5.  continuity of coverage and enrollment protections;

6.  consumer enforcement and restitution rights.

These standards shall constitute a national floor, not a ceiling.

### **(b) Preservation of Stronger State Protections**

States may enact or maintain consumer protections that exceed federal standards, provided such protections do not undermine national affordability, access, or stability.

## **SEC. 804. STATE ADMINISTRATION OPTIONS.**

### **(a) State Administration of the Backbone**

A state may elect to administer the Healthcare Backbone Plan within the state, subject to approval by the Secretary, provided the state demonstrates that:

1.  coverage will meet or exceed federal standards;

2.  affordability protections will be enforced uniformly;

3.  provider access and rural stabilization requirements will be satisfied;

4.  administrative simplification goals will be met.

### **(b) Federal Backstop**

If a state elects not to administer the Healthcare Backbone Plan, or fails to meet required standards, the Secretary shall administer the Plan directly within that state.

No resident shall be denied access based on state participation decisions.

## **SEC. 805. STREAMLINED WAIVER AND INNOVATION AUTHORITY.**

### **(a) Unified Innovation Waiver**

The Secretary shall establish a unified waiver pathway that may consolidate or coordinate existing waiver authorities, including but not limited to:

- section 1332 State Innovation Waivers;

- section 1115 Medicaid demonstration waivers;

- other relevant authorities as appropriate.

### **(b) Waiver Approval Criteria**

A waiver may be approved only if the Secretary determines that the proposal:

1.  expands or maintains coverage;

2.  lowers or does not increase total cost to consumers;

3.  improves or maintains access to care;

4.  protects vulnerable and rural populations;

5.  does not increase federal spending over the waiver period.

### **(c) Prohibition on Waivers That Increase Complexity**

Waivers that primarily increase administrative complexity, coverage fragmentation, or consumer confusion shall not be approved.

## **SEC. 806. RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREA INNOVATION PRIORITY.**

### **(a) Priority Consideration**

The Secretary shall prioritize approval of state proposals that:

1.  stabilize rural hospitals and clinics;

2.  expand maternity, emergency, and behavioral health services;

3.  address workforce shortages;

4.  improve access in geographically isolated areas.

### **(b) Technical Assistance**

The Secretary may provide technical assistance and planning support to states seeking to develop proposals that address rural and underserved needs.

## **SEC. 807. DATA SHARING AND INTEROPERABILITY.**

### **(a) Federal--State Data Coordination**

The Secretary shall establish standards and processes to ensure:

1.  seamless data sharing between federal and state agencies;

2.  reduced duplication of eligibility and enrollment processes;

3.  improved program integrity and oversight.

### **(b) Privacy and Security**

All data sharing shall comply with applicable privacy and security protections.

## **SEC. 808. OVERSIGHT, TRANSPARENCY, AND EVALUATION.**

### **(a) Public Transparency**

The Secretary shall publish:

1.  waiver applications and approvals;

2.  evaluation criteria and findings;

3.  performance outcomes associated with approved waivers.

### **(b) Ongoing Evaluation**

Approved waivers shall be subject to:

- periodic evaluation;

- public reporting;

- modification or termination if standards are no longer met.

## **SEC. 809. FUNDING AND BUDGET NEUTRALITY.**

### **(a) Budget Neutrality**

All state-administered programs and waivers under this title shall be budget neutral to the federal government.

### **(b) Use of Savings**

Documented savings achieved through approved innovations may be reinvested in:

- affordability protections;

- rural stabilization;

- access expansion;

- administrative simplification.

## **SEC. 810. RULEMAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION.**

### **(a) Rulemaking Authority**

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this title.

### **(b) Coordination Timeline**

The Secretary shall establish timelines for:

- state election of administrative options;

- waiver submission and review;

- implementation of approved programs.

## **SEC. 811. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title VIII matters**

This title:

- prevents a race to the bottom,

- preserves innovation without loopholes,

- protects people regardless of geography,

- and ensures the backbone works everywhere.

It balances national fairness with local problem-solving.
