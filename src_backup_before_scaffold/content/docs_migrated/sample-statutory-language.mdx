# **SAMPLE STATUTORY LANGUAGE**

## **ACA for the People (Model Draft)**

## **SECTION 301. STATUTORY AFFORDABILITY CAPS AND COST PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) IN GENERAL.**

Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

> "(k) STATUTORY AFFORDABILITY CAPS.
>
> \(1\) MAXIMUM PREMIUM CONTRIBUTION.
>
> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annual premium contribution required of an applicable taxpayer for coverage under a qualified health plan or Healthcare Backbone Plan shall not exceed the applicable percentage of household income set forth in paragraph (2).
>
> \(2\) APPLICABLE PERCENTAGES.
>
> For purposes of paragraph (1), the applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Household Income (% FPL)**        **Maximum Premium Contribution**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  â‰¤ 150%                              0.0 percent

  \>150%--200%                        2.0 percent

  \>200%--300%                        4.0 percent

  \>300%--400%                        6.0 percent

  \>400%                              8.5 percent
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

> \(3\) PROHIBITION ON COST SHIFTING.
>
> No issuer may impose deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing mechanisms that, individually or in aggregate, have the effect of circumventing the premium contribution limits established under this subsection.
>
> \(4\) TRUE OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM.
>
> For purposes of this Act, the term 'out-of-pocket maximum' shall include all cost-sharing expenditures for covered services, including prescription drugs, out-of-network emergency services, and ancillary services. No exclusions shall apply unless expressly authorized by statute.
>
> \(5\) NONDISCRETIONARY ENFORCEMENT.
>
> Compliance with this subsection shall be mandatory. The Secretary shall not waive, suspend, or modify the requirements of this subsection through regulation, guidance, or enforcement discretion.
>
> \(6\) JUDICIAL REVIEW.
>
> Failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review."

### **(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.**

Section 1302(c) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. Â§18022(c)) is amended to conform cost-sharing limitations to subsection (k) of section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code.

### **ðŸ”Ž Why this section is strong**

- Affordability is numerical, not discretionary

- Caps are enforceable without agency enthusiasm

- Courts can read and apply it directly

- Insurers cannot game around it with cost-shifting

- This survives a hostile administration and a hostile court

## **SECTION 701. PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATE PASS-THROUGH AND SPREAD PRICING PROHIBITION.**

### **(a) REBATE PASS-THROUGH REQUIREMENT.**

Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Â§300gg et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

> "SEC. 2799D--1. PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATE TRANSPARENCY AND PASS-THROUGH.
>
> \(a\) IN GENERAL.
>
> Any rebate, discount, price concession, or other remuneration received by a health plan, pharmacy benefit manager, or any affiliate thereof, in connection with a covered prescription drug, shall be applied directly to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the covered individual at the point of sale.
>
> \(b\) PROHIBITION ON RETENTION.
>
> No entity described in subsection (a) may retain, aggregate, or reallocate such remuneration for any purpose other than reducing the cost of the drug to the covered individual.
>
> \(c\) NO OFFSET OR DELAY.
>
> The application of remuneration under this section shall not be deferred, averaged, or offset through premium adjustments or other mechanisms.
>
> \(d\) ENFORCEMENT.
>
> A violation of this section shall be treated as a prohibited transaction subject to civil monetary penalties not to exceed \$100,000 per violation, adjusted annually for inflation.
>
> \(e\) NONPREEMPTION OF STRONGER FEDERAL PROTECTIONS.
>
> Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to impose stricter transparency or consumer protection requirements under Federal law."

### **(b) SPREAD PRICING BAN.**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after section 725 the following:

> "SEC. 725A. PROHIBITION ON SPREAD PRICING.
>
> \(a\) IN GENERAL.
>
> A pharmacy benefit manager shall not charge a health plan sponsor a price for a prescription drug that exceeds the amount paid to the dispensing pharmacy for such drug, except for a bona fide administrative fee disclosed in advance.
>
> \(b\) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.
>
> Any administrative fee permitted under subsection (a) shall be:
>
> \(1\) flat and not percentage-based;
>
> \(2\) disclosed in writing; and
>
> \(3\) unrelated to the price of the drug.
>
> \(c\) PROHIBITED PRACTICE.
>
> Any differential between amounts charged and amounts paid, other than permitted fees, shall constitute unlawful spread pricing.
>
> \(d\) PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT.
>
> A plan sponsor, pharmacy, or covered individual adversely affected by a violation of this section may bring an action for injunctive relief."

### **ðŸ”Ž Why this section is strong**

- No rate-setting (avoids takings claims)

- No agency creativity required

- ERISA-safe federal authority

- Mechanical compliance = easy auditing

- Patients feel savings immediately

## **What we've now done (this is important)**

You now have:

- real statutory text

- that could be dropped into a draft bill

- with minimal reinterpretation

- and maximum durability

This is no longer "policy language."

This is law-shaped.
