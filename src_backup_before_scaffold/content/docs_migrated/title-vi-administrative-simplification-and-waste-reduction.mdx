# **Title VI --- Administrative Simplification and Waste Reduction**

(Lowering costs by fixing the machinery, not cutting care)

## **SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Healthcare Administrative Simplification and Efficiency Act."

## **SEC. 602. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.**

### **(a) Purpose**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  reduce administrative waste that drives healthcare costs without improving care;

2.  simplify enrollment, billing, and coverage maintenance;

3.  eliminate duplicative and unnecessary processes;

4.  improve provider efficiency and workforce retention;

5.  lower federal and private healthcare spending through structural efficiency; and

6.  support affordability protections without reducing benefits.

### **(b) Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- administrative costs in U.S. healthcare are significantly higher than in peer nations;

- complex billing and eligibility systems contribute to coverage loss and delayed care;

- providers spend excessive time and resources on non-clinical tasks;

- administrative burden disproportionately harms small and rural providers;

- and simplification yields cost savings without compromising quality or access.

## **SEC. 603. SIMPLIFIED ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS.**

### **(a) No-Wrong-Door Enrollment**

The Secretary shall establish a no-wrong-door enrollment system that:

1.  allows individuals to enroll through multiple entry points, including:

    - Health Insurance Marketplaces,

    - Medicaid and CHIP agencies,

    - other public benefit programs as appropriate;

2.  ensures seamless transitions between coverage programs;

3.  prevents loss of coverage due to administrative handoffs.

### **(b) Use of Existing Data**

The Secretary shall maximize the use of existing, reliable data sources to:

- verify eligibility,

- update income information,

- and reduce documentation burdens.

### **(c) Continuous Eligibility**

The Secretary shall establish continuous eligibility periods sufficient to:

- reduce churn,

- maintain continuity of care,

- and prevent disenrollment due to temporary changes or administrative delays.

## **SEC. 604. STANDARDIZED BILLING AND CLAIMS PROCESSING.**

### **(a) Uniform Billing Standards**

The Secretary shall establish standardized billing and claims formats applicable to plans subject to this Act, including:

1.  uniform coding requirements;

2.  standardized documentation thresholds;

3.  simplified claims submission processes.

### **(b) Timely Payment Requirements**

Plans shall:

1.  adjudicate clean claims within standardized timeframes;

2.  provide clear explanations for any denial or delay;

3.  pay interest or penalties on unjustified payment delays.

### **(c) Reduction of Redundant Submissions**

Plans may not require duplicative information or documentation already provided through standardized processes.

## **SEC. 605. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SIMPLIFICATION AND AUTOMATION.**

### **(a) Streamlined Processes**

Where prior authorization is permitted, the Secretary shall require:

1.  standardized authorization criteria;

2.  electronic submission and response systems;

3.  real-time or near-real-time determinations for routine services.

### **(b) Authorization Portability**

Approved authorizations shall:

- follow the patient across plans during coverage transitions;

- apply for defined continuity periods;

- not require reauthorization absent clinical change.

### **(c) Prohibition on Administrative Delay**

Administrative inefficiency shall not be used as a justification for delay or denial of care.

## **SEC. 606. SIMPLIFICATION FOR PROVIDERS AND SMALL PRACTICES.**

### **(a) Administrative Relief for Small and Rural Providers**

The Secretary shall develop simplified participation pathways for:

- rural hospitals,

- independent practices,

- community clinics,

- safety-net providers.

### **(b) Reporting Rationalization**

The Secretary shall:

1.  review existing reporting requirements;

2.  eliminate duplicative or low-value reporting;

3.  consolidate metrics where possible.

### **(c) Technical Assistance**

The Secretary may provide technical assistance to support transition to simplified systems.

## **SEC. 607. TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY.**

### **(a) Modern Systems**

The Secretary shall promote modernization of:

- enrollment platforms,

- eligibility systems,

- claims processing infrastructure.

### **(b) Interoperability Standards**

Systems shall:

- communicate seamlessly across programs and plans;

- minimize manual data entry;

- protect privacy and security.

### **(c) Avoidance of Vendor Lock-In**

Technology standards shall:

- encourage competition,

- prevent proprietary lock-in,

- allow system upgrades without full replacement.

## **SEC. 608. ADMINISTRATIVE COST MEASUREMENT AND TRANSPARENCY.**

### **(a) Measurement**

The Secretary shall establish metrics to measure:

- administrative cost as a share of total spending;

- time spent by providers on non-clinical tasks;

- coverage loss due to administrative causes.

### **(b) Public Reporting**

Annual reports shall be published detailing:

- administrative cost trends;

- savings achieved through simplification;

- areas requiring further reform.

## **SEC. 609. FUNDING AND SAVINGS RECAPTURE.**

### **(a) Funding**

Activities under this title shall be funded through:

- reallocation of existing administrative budgets;

- savings generated by simplification;

- reduced federal and private administrative spending.

### **(b) Savings Recapture**

Documented savings may be:

- reinvested in affordability protections;

- used to stabilize provider payment;

- applied to deficit reduction where appropriate.

## **SEC. 610. RULEMAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION.**

### **(a) Rulemaking Authority**

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this title.

### **(b) Phased Implementation**

Implementation may be phased to:

- ensure operational readiness;

- prioritize high-cost administrative burdens;

- avoid disruption to care delivery.

## **SEC. 611. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title VI matters**

This title:

- permanently lowers system costs,

- reduces burnout among healthcare workers,

- stabilizes small and rural providers,

- and pays for affordability without cuts or taxes.

Administrative waste is not inevitable.

It is a policy choice --- and it can be undone.
