# **ACA for the People**

## **A one-page overview**

### **A healthcare overhaul built for regular Americans --- not insurance companies**

## **The problem**

Healthcare in the United States costs too much, covers people unevenly, and still leaves families financially exposed --- even when they're insured.

The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage and banned discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. That mattered.

But it left the power structure of healthcare untouched.

Insurance companies still:

- design plans that shift costs onto patients,

- delay and deny care through paperwork,

- profit from complexity,

- and control access --- especially in rural areas.

As a result:

- premiums and deductibles keep rising,

- medical debt is common among insured people,

- rural hospitals are closing,

- and public spending grows without delivering affordability.

Incremental fixes are no longer enough.

## **The solution: a new healthcare backbone**

ACA for the People modernizes the Affordable Care Act by building a new healthcare backbone --- a guaranteed baseline that works everywhere and sets fair rules for everyone.

The backbone is:

- available to all Americans,

- simple and predictable,

- designed around affordability and access,

- and strong enough to force honest competition.

Private insurance continues to exist --- but it no longer runs the system.

## **What this delivers**

### **1. Real affordability**

- Monthly premiums are capped based on income

- There is a true annual limit on what families can pay

- Preventive, chronic, mental health, and maternity care are affordable at the point of service

No fine print. No surprises. No medical bankruptcy.

### **2. Universal and fair access**

- Everyone has a real coverage option, regardless of job or ZIP code

- Coverage doesn't disappear because of paperwork or small income changes

- States cannot weaken basic protections

Healthcare stops being a geographic gamble.

### **3. Power shifts away from insurance companies**

- Plans must be simple and comparable

- Prior authorization abuse is limited

- Delay and denial as a business strategy are prohibited

- Insurers compete on value --- not confusion

Care decisions return to patients and doctors.

### **4. Rural hospitals stay open**

- Providers are paid for access and readiness, not just volume

- Rural hospitals receive stable, predictable funding

- Administrative burden is reduced

- Local care remains local

A national system that only works in cities is no longer acceptable.

### **5. Lower drug prices**

- Rebates and discounts go to patients at the pharmacy counter

- Middleman pricing games are banned

- Generic and biosimilar competition is protected

- Independent pharmacies are stabilized

People pay the real price --- not an inflated one.

## **How this is paid for (no new taxes)**

ACA for the People is funded by:

- closing insurance loopholes,

- reducing administrative waste,

- ending drug pricing games,

- stabilizing coverage to reduce emergency care,

- and lowering prices through real competition.

Lower prices mean lower subsidy costs.

This is cost control through system design, not tax increases.

## **Why this can pass Congress**

This proposal:

- builds on existing law,

- phases in change,

- protects people immediately,

- avoids disruption,

- and uses regulatory authority where possible.

It includes:

- a best-possible blueprint, and

- a realistic, passable legislative pathway.

It is reform designed for governing --- not posturing.

## **What makes this different**

Most healthcare proposals focus on:

- ideology, or

- subsidies, or

- one piece of the system.

ACA for the People focuses on structure.

It fixes the foundation so:

- affordability is enforced,

- access is stable,

- and power is balanced.

## **The bottom line**

> Healthcare should work for people --- not against them.

ACA for the People delivers:

- lower costs,

- real protection,

- universal access,

- strong rural care,

- and lasting accountability.

It doesn't ask Americans to trust the system.

It makes the system worthy of trust.
