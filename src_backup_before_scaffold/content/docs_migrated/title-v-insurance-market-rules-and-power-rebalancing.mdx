# **Title V --- Insurance Market Rules and Power Rebalancing**

(Ending profit through confusion, delay, and design)

## **SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Insurance Accountability and Market Fairness Act."

## **SEC. 502. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.**

### **(a) Purpose**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  rebalance power in health insurance markets;

2.  ensure insurers operate as financial intermediaries, not care gatekeepers;

3.  eliminate profit derived from delay, confusion, and discriminatory plan design;

4.  strengthen enforcement of consumer protections; and

5.  align insurance incentives with patient access and system affordability.

### **(b) Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- insurance market concentration limits competition;

- administrative complexity enables cost-shifting and delay;

- existing consumer protections are insufficiently enforced;

- insurer profit is often derived from reduced utilization rather than improved care;

- and meaningful affordability requires structural accountability.

## **SEC. 503. PLAN DESIGN STANDARDIZATION AND FAIRNESS.**

### **(a) Standardized Plan Structures**

The Secretary shall establish standardized plan designs applicable to all plans subject to this title, including:

1.  standardized deductibles;

2.  standardized copayment and coinsurance structures;

3.  standardized out-of-pocket maximum integration;

4.  uniform presentation of benefits and costs.

Standardization shall be sufficient to:

- enable meaningful comparison;

- prevent deceptive affordability claims;

- and limit discriminatory design.

### **(b) Prohibited Design Practices**

It shall be unlawful for an insurer to:

1.  design benefits primarily to discourage enrollment by individuals with higher medical needs;

2.  rely on excessive deductibles to shift cost while advertising affordability;

3.  structure benefits to evade affordability caps or cost protections;

4.  use tiering or exclusions that materially impair access to essential care.

## **SEC. 504. NETWORK ADEQUACY AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS.**

### **(a) Real-World Access Standards**

Network adequacy shall be assessed based on:

- appointment availability;

- geographic access;

- provider capacity;

- specialty access;

- and continuity of care.

Paper compliance shall not be sufficient.

### **(b) Provider Inclusion**

Plans shall ensure reasonable inclusion of:

- essential community providers;

- rural hospitals;

- behavioral health providers;

- maternity care providers;

- and specialty care where required.

### **(c) Enforcement**

Failure to meet network adequacy requirements shall result in:

- corrective action mandates;

- financial penalties;

- consumer restitution;

- or plan decertification.

## **SEC. 505. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REFORM AND ACCOUNTABILITY.**

### **(a) Permissible Use**

Prior authorization may be used only where:

1.  supported by clinical evidence;

2.  necessary to prevent clear harm or waste;

3.  administered without undue delay.

### **(b) Prohibited Uses**

Prior authorization shall not be used:

1.  as a default utilization control;

2.  to delay care without individualized clinical review;

3.  for services with established clinical necessity;

4.  to override provider judgment absent documented justification.

### **(c) Transparency and Reporting**

Insurers shall publicly report:

- denial rates;

- approval timelines;

- reversal rates on appeal;

- and service-specific authorization data.

## **SEC. 506. MEDICAL LOSS RATIO (MLR) REFORM.**

### **(a) Tightened Definitions**

The Secretary shall revise MLR definitions to ensure:

1.  administrative expenses are not misclassified as quality improvement;

2.  marketing and broker incentives are excluded from medical spending;

3.  executive compensation is appropriately categorized.

### **(b) Enhanced Auditing**

The Secretary shall:

- conduct regular, independent audits;

- prioritize high-risk plans;

- require corrective action where misclassification is found.

### **(c) Automatic Rebates**

Failure to meet MLR standards shall result in:

- automatic consumer rebates;

- public disclosure of violations;

- escalating penalties for repeat offenders.

## **SEC. 507. PROHIBITION ON PROFIT FROM DELAY OR DENIAL.**

### **(a) General Rule**

It shall be unlawful for an insurer to derive financial benefit from:

1.  systematic delay of care;

2.  unjustified denial of covered services;

3.  procedural barriers designed to reduce utilization.

### **(b) Presumption of Violation**

Patterns of delay or denial resulting in:

- worsened health outcomes;

- increased downstream costs;

- or repeated appeal reversals\
  \
  shall create a rebuttable presumption of violation.

## **SEC. 508. CONSUMER RESTITUTION AND ENFORCEMENT.**

### **(a) Restitution**

Consumers harmed by violations of this title shall be entitled to:

- reimbursement of improper charges;

- compensation for costs incurred due to delay or denial;

- restoration of coverage.

### **(b) Enforcement Authority**

The Secretary may:

- impose civil monetary penalties;

- suspend or revoke plan certification;

- refer matters for further enforcement.

### **(c) Whistleblower Protections**

Employees and contractors who report violations shall be protected from retaliation.

## **SEC. 509. MARKET CONDUCT TRANSPARENCY.**

### **(a) Public Reporting**

The Secretary shall publish annual reports on:

- plan affordability outcomes;

- denial and delay practices;

- network adequacy performance;

- enforcement actions taken.

### **(b) Consumer Access**

Information shall be made available in:

- plain language;

- machine-readable formats;

- standardized comparison tools.

## **SEC. 510. RULEMAKING AND EFFECTIVE DATES.**

### **(a) Rulemaking**

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this title.

### **(b) Phased Enforcement**

Enforcement may be phased to:

- allow compliance;

- prioritize high-impact abuses;

- avoid market disruption.

## **SEC. 511. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title V matters**

This title:

- ends profit-through-confusion,

- eliminates denial-as-strategy,

- forces honest competition,

- and makes insurers accountable to people --- not paperwork.

Without Title V, affordability caps fail.

With Title V, the backbone holds.
