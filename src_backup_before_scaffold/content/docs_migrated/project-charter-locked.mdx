# **PROJECT CHARTER (LOCKED)**

## **Project Name (working)**

ACA for the People: A Power-Shifting Healthcare Overhaul

(Tagline we can refine later: Lower costs. Universal access. Fair rules. No new taxes.)

## **Mission**

Design a people-first overhaul of the Affordable Care Act that:

- lowers total healthcare costs,

- caps what families pay,

- guarantees universal, fair access,

- keeps rural hospitals alive,

- shifts power away from insurance companies, and

- can be passed by Congress without raising taxes.

This project will produce an actual legislative blueprint, not just commentary.

## **Non-Negotiable Constraints**

- âœ… No new taxes

- âœ… Universal availability (no coverage gaps)

- âœ… Strong caps on premiums + out-of-pocket costs

- âœ… New public backbone (not just tweaks)

- âœ… Private insurers may participate, but do not control the system

- âœ… Rural hospitals explicitly protected

- âœ… Two-track output:

  - Best Possible Blueprint

  - Congressional Passable Version

## **Core Philosophy**

> Healthcare should be governed by rules that protect people, not by private incentives that exploit complexity.

If insurers cannot profit without loopholes, they should not profit at all.

# **2ï¸âƒ£ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (HOW THIS BECOMES REAL)**

## **A) Policy Architecture (How we think)**

We are not "reforming the ACA."

We are replacing its weak spine while preserving its strongest protections.

The project is organized into five power centers:

1.  The Backbone\
    \
    The guaranteed baseline plan available to everyone.

2.  Affordability Controls\
    \
    Caps, subsidies, and cost discipline that reduce total spend.

3.  Market Rules\
    \
    What insurers can and cannot do.

4.  Provider Pricing & Rural Stability\
    \
    Hospitals, clinics, workforce, survival.

5.  Administration & Enforcement\
    \
    Where good policy usually fails --- we won't ignore this.

Every proposal must say:

- Which power center it affects

- Who loses power

- How costs actually fall

## **B) Website Architecture (Netlify / Static / Plain English)**

This site is both:

- an open policy notebook, and

- a teachable platform for average Americans.

### **Writing rules (locked)**

- Every page starts with a 1-minute summary

- No jargon without explanation

- Always answer:

  - What is this?

  - Why does it matter?

  - How does it hurt or help people?

  - What changes under our plan?

# **3ï¸âƒ£ SYSTEM TRASH INVENTORY (THE ENGINE OF REFORM)**

This is where we pay for reform without taxes.

We will maintain a running list of "system trash" --- money extracted without improving care.

### **Initial Trash Categories**

Each item becomes its own explainer page + reform proposal.

#### **Insurance Trash**

- MLR accounting games

- Prior authorization abuse

- Narrow network manipulation

- Broker steering incentives

- Churn exploitation

- Complexity-as-profit strategy

#### **Provider Trash**

- Facility fees

- Monopoly pricing

- Contract opacity

- Vertical integration games

- Overbilling through coding intensity

#### **Drug & PBM Trash**

- Rebate walls

- Spread pricing

- Formulary manipulation

- Pharmacy clawbacks

#### **Administrative Trash**

- Duplicate eligibility systems

- Paperwork-induced disenrollment

- IT failures that cost coverage

- State-by-state fragmentation

Rule:

If a dollar doesn't improve care or access, it's fair game.

# **4ï¸âƒ£ THE BACKBONE (WHAT WE'RE BUILDING TOWARD)**

We are not picking the backbone yet.

We are forcing the options to compete.

### **Backbone Options We Will Test**

1.  National Public Option

2.  Medicare / Medicaid Buy-In

3.  Expanded Basic Health Program

4.  Hybrid public backbone + private wrap

Each option will be scored against:

- Affordability

- Universality

- Rural viability

- Insurer power reduction

- Administrative simplicity

- Congressional passability

No sacred cows.

# **5ï¸âƒ£ FIRST RESEARCH SPRINT (NEXT STEPS)**

## **Sprint 1: "Why Healthcare Is So Expensive"**

Goal: build a shared factual foundation before proposing fixes.

Deliverables:

1.  Plain-English cost map

    - where every dollar goes

2.  Insurance power explainer

    - how profit is extracted

3.  Rural collapse explainer

    - why hospitals are dying even with insurance

This sprint feeds:

- the "Problem" section of the site

- the justification for a new backbone

# **6ï¸âƒ£ HOW WE PROCEED FROM HERE**

Next response, I will:

- Draft Start Here: The 10-Minute Overview (public-facing)

- Write "What We Mean by a New Backbone" (simple but serious)

- Start the System Trash Inventory with the first insurer loophole

From there, we'll alternate between:

- public-facing pages, and

- deep policy memos behind them.

This is now a real project.

No vibes. No hand-waving. No corporate deference.

When you're ready, say one of these and I'll proceed immediately:

- "Start Here page first"

- "Begin with insurance loopholes"

- "Show me the backbone options matrix"
