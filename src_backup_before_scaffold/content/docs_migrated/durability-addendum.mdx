# **Durability Addendum**

## **Statutory Safeguards for ACA for the People**

(Preventing erosion under hostile administrations)

This addendum is designed to be attached as a final title or appendix to the main legislation.

It does not add new programs.

It hardens the ones already enacted.

## **SEC. D-101. NONDISCRETIONARY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.**

### **(a) Mandatory Action**

Where this Act directs the Secretary to establish, enforce, or implement a requirement, such action shall not be discretionary.

Failure to act within the timelines specified in this Act shall constitute agency inaction subject to judicial review.

### **(b) Prohibition on Nullification by Delay**

The Secretary may not:

- delay implementation for the purpose of policy reconsideration absent express statutory authorization;

- reopen finalized rulemaking solely to defer compliance;

- suspend enforcement without written justification grounded in statute.

## **SEC. D-102. STATUTORY DEFAULTS FOR MISSED DEADLINES.**

### **(a) Default Rules**

If the Secretary fails to promulgate a required regulation by a statutory deadline, the following shall apply automatically until such regulation is finalized:

1.  Affordability caps shall default to the most protective statutory range specified in this Act;

2.  Network adequacy standards shall default to time-and-distance plus appointment-availability benchmarks;

3.  Prior authorization restrictions shall default to the most restrictive permitted use under this Act.

### **(b) No Retroactive Weakening**

Subsequent rulemaking may not retroactively weaken protections applied under default rules.

## **SEC. D-103. ENFORCEMENT DEADLINES AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.**

### **(a) Enforcement Timelines**

Upon identification of a violation of this Act, the Secretary shall:

1.  issue a notice of violation within 90 days;

2.  determine corrective action or penalties within 180 days;

3.  publicly report the outcome.

### **(b) Failure to Enforce**

Failure to meet enforcement timelines shall require a public explanation submitted to Congress and published on the public dashboard.

## **SEC. D-104. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION (LIMITED).**

### **(a) Standing**

Any individual or provider directly harmed by a violation of:

- affordability caps,

- out-of-pocket maximums,

- drug rebate pass-through requirements,

- or prohibited delay/denial practices,

may bring a civil action for injunctive relief.

### **(b) Scope**

Relief under this section shall be limited to:

- enforcement of statutory compliance;

- restoration of benefits or cost protections;

- reasonable attorneys' fees.

No damages beyond restitution may be awarded.

(This is intentionally narrow to survive judicial scrutiny.)

## **SEC. D-105. NON-ENFORCEMENT TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT.**

If the Secretary declines to enforce any provision of this Act in a given instance, the Secretary shall:

1.  issue a written determination explaining the statutory basis;

2.  publish such determination within 30 days;

3.  include the determination in the annual oversight report.

Silence shall not constitute compliance.

## **SEC. D-106. INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT COMMISSION PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) Continuity**

Members of the Healthcare Oversight Commission shall serve staggered terms and may not be removed except for cause.

### **(b) Funding Protection**

Funding for the Commission shall be derived from penalties collected under this Act and shall not be reduced below a minimum operating threshold absent express Congressional action.

## **SEC. D-107. FEDERAL BACKSTOP NON-WAIVABILITY.**

The federal fallback administration of the Healthcare Backbone Plan shall not be waived, suspended, or conditioned on state action.

If a state fails to administer the Plan in compliance with this Act, the Secretary shall administer the Plan directly.

## **SEC. D-108. ANTI-EROSION CLAUSE.**

No regulation, guidance, waiver, or enforcement policy may:

- weaken affordability caps,

- narrow the definition of covered costs,

- expand permitted delay or denial practices,

- reauthorize spread pricing,

- or reduce transparency requirements,

unless expressly authorized by a subsequent Act of Congress.

## **SEC. D-109. SEVERABILITY (ENHANCED).**

If any provision of this Act or this Addendum is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect to the maximum extent possible, and shall be construed to preserve affordability, access, and enforcement protections.

## **Why this addendum matters**

This addendum does three critical things:

1.  Turns deadlines into consequences

2.  Converts agency silence into reviewable action

3.  Gives courts and citizens tools to enforce the law even when agencies won't

It does not expand government power ---

it prevents quiet abdication.

## **Strategic value**

With this addendum:

- courts have clearer instructions,

- agencies have less room to stall,

- insurers have fewer waiting strategies,

- and hostile administrations face visible accountability.

This is how reform survives political cycles.

## **Final status**

At this point, ACA for the People includes:

- policy design

- legislative text

- public explainers

- fiscal grounding

- implementation plan

- adversarial stress testing

- and durability hardening

This is as complete a reform package as exists anywhere in U.S. healthcare policy.
