# **Full Blueprint Outline**

## **ACA for the People**

(Master structure for legislation, regulation, and implementation)

Paste into:

/proposal/full-blueprint.html

This outline is intentionally written so it can be:

- converted into legislative text,

- split across committees,

- phased over multiple bills,

- and implemented through regulation where authorized.

# **I. Purpose and Findings**

### **I.1 Purpose**

To modernize the Affordable Care Act by establishing a national healthcare backbone that:

- guarantees affordable, stable coverage,

- caps financial exposure for individuals and families,

- stabilizes rural healthcare infrastructure,

- reduces administrative waste,

- and shifts systemic power away from insurance companies toward patients and communities,\
  \
  without raising taxes.

### **I.2 Congressional Findings**

Congress finds that:

- healthcare costs continue to outpace wages and inflation,

- insured individuals remain exposed to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs,

- private insurance market concentration undermines competition,

- rural hospitals face systemic financial instability,

- administrative complexity increases costs without improving outcomes,

- and existing law lacks a unified, enforceable affordability foundation.

# **II. Definitions and Scope**

### **II.1 Definitions**

Establish statutory definitions for:

- "Healthcare Backbone"

- "Baseline Coverage"

- "Affordability Caps"

## **What this outline does**

This blueprint:

- gives Congress a real drafting map,

- prevents scope creep,

- allows modular passage,

- and keeps reform grounded in law and administration.

It is buildable, defensible, and adaptable.
