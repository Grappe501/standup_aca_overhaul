# **Executive Summary**

## **ACA for the People**

(A people-first healthcare overhaul that lowers costs, protects families, and keeps care local --- without raising taxes)

Paste into:

/proposal/executive-summary.html

## **The problem**

Healthcare in the United States costs too much, covers people unevenly, and leaves families financially exposed even when they are insured.

While the Affordable Care Act significantly expanded coverage and established essential consumer protections, it did not change the underlying power structure of the healthcare system. Insurance companies continue to control plan design, pricing leverage remains largely unchecked, rural hospitals are failing, and administrative complexity drives up costs without improving care.

The result is a system where:

- families pay more each year,

- out-of-pocket costs remain unpredictable,

- coverage is unstable,

- rural access is shrinking,

- and public spending increases without delivering affordability.

Incremental fixes and subsidies alone are no longer sufficient.

## **The solution**

ACA for the People proposes a structural overhaul that builds a new healthcare backbone --- a simple, universal baseline plan that guarantees affordability, stabilizes access, and shifts power away from insurance companies and toward patients, providers, and communities.

The proposal:

- lowers premiums and out-of-pocket costs,

- caps what families can be required to pay,

- guarantees universal access to coverage,

- stabilizes rural hospitals and essential services,

- reduces administrative waste,

- and does not raise taxes.

Private insurance continues to exist, but no longer controls the foundation of the system.

## **Core principles**

Every element of this proposal adheres to seven non-negotiable principles:

1.  Affordability first --- real limits on what families pay, not just nominal coverage.

2.  Universal and fair access --- no coverage gaps, cliffs, or state-based dead ends.

3.  Financial protection --- no medical bankruptcy due to illness or injury.

4.  No new taxes --- reform is funded by eliminating waste and overpricing.

5.  Rural viability --- care must remain close to home.

6.  Power shift --- insurers may participate, but they do not design the system.

7.  Passability --- reforms must be realistic, lawful, and implementable.

## **The healthcare backbone**

At the center of the proposal is a national healthcare backbone with the following features:

- Universal availability to all Americans

- Standardized benefits and cost-sharing

- Clear affordability caps tied to income

- Stable, predictable coverage

- Simplified enrollment and administration

- A credible public baseline that forces honest competition

The backbone may be implemented as:

- a national public option,

- a hybrid public plan with private wraparound coverage,

- or a phased rollout beginning in underserved and rural markets.

The design is flexible, but the function is fixed: the backbone sets the rules of the road.

## **Affordability protections**

The proposal establishes enforceable caps on:

- monthly premiums,

- annual out-of-pocket spending,

- and point-of-care costs for essential services.

Affordability is defined by total expected cost, not marketing labels.

These protections:

- prevent financial ruin,

- reduce delayed care,

- stabilize coverage,

- and lower total system costs over time.

## **Provider payment and rural stabilization**

To ensure access does not disappear as costs fall, the proposal reforms provider payment to:

- reward access and readiness, not just volume,

- reduce administrative burden,

- stabilize rural hospitals through predictable funding,

- support essential services such as emergency and maternity care,

- and discourage unnecessary consolidation.

Rural hospitals are treated as essential infrastructure --- not market casualties.

## **Cost control without tax increases**

The proposal is funded by:

- closing insurance loopholes,

- reducing administrative waste,

- disciplining prices through competition,

- stabilizing risk pools,

- and eliminating rent extraction.

Lower prices lead directly to lower subsidy costs.

This is cost control through system design --- not cost shifting to families or taxpayers.

## **Legislative pathway**

The proposal is designed to move through Congress using a three-track strategy:

1.  Immediate protections attached to must-pass legislation

2.  Backbone authorization through targeted statutory reform

3.  Regulatory implementation using existing agency authority

Reform is phased, pragmatic, and adaptable --- avoiding disruption while delivering results.

## **Outcomes**

If enacted, ACA for the People will:

- reduce healthcare costs for families,

- eliminate coverage gaps,

- protect against medical debt,

- stabilize rural healthcare systems,

- simplify coverage and care,

- and restore public confidence that healthcare works for people.

## **Conclusion**

Healthcare reform succeeds when it focuses on structure, not slogans.

ACA for the People modernizes the Affordable Care Act by fixing what it could not --- the foundation itself.

It is affordable.

It is fair.

It is realistic.

And it puts people first.

### **Next steps**

The full proposal includes:

- detailed policy chapters,

- legislative section-by-section language,

- implementation timelines,

- and fiscal analysis.

This executive summary is the starting point --- not the end.
