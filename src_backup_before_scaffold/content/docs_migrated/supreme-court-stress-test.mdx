# **Supreme Court Stress Test**

## **How ACA for the People holds up under today's Court**

### **Baseline reality**

- The current Supreme Court remains the familiar nine (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson).

- Since Loper Bright, agencies get far less judicial deference when statutes are ambiguous. Courts will push for "best meaning," not "reasonable agency interpretation."

- The ACA itself has survived multiple Supreme Court challenges (NFIB; King; California v. Texas), but the Court has shown it will trim what it views as coercive or structurally improper.

Translation: Your plan needs (1) clean statutory authority, (2) non-coercive state options, (3) tight nondelegation/appointments hygiene, and (4) severability.

## **1) Biggest litigation magnet: "Backbone plan" authority**

### **Likely claim**

Opponents argue the backbone is a major question and HHS can't implement it unless Congress speaks clearly.

### **What survives**

A backbone plan is strongest if Congress:

- creates it explicitly in statute

- specifies core features (eligibility, benefits floor, affordability caps, funding mechanism)

- limits agency discretion to implementation mechanics, not major policy choices

### **Vulnerability**

If the statute says "HHS shall create a backbone with affordability caps as the Secretary determines," that's lawsuit fuel under post-Chevron review and major-questions framing.

### **Hardening moves (do these)**

Drafting fix: Put the backbone's non-negotiables into the statute itself:

- universal availability (who can enroll)

- minimum benefits and standardized tiers

- explicit affordability cap formula ranges (e.g., % of income bands) rather than "as Secretary decides"

- explicit out-of-pocket maximum structure (what counts; no carveouts)

- explicit funding sources (savings capture mechanisms)

This converts "agency invention" into Congressional instruction.

## **2) State coercion / Spending Clause (NFIB risk)**

NFIB held the ACA's Medicaid expansion became unconstitutionally coercive when tied to potential loss of all Medicaid funds; remedy was limiting enforcement to expansion funds.

### **Likely claim**

States sue saying: "Federal fallback + national floor + waiver limits = coercion."

### **What survives**

Your structure is already oriented toward survival if:

- states are not forced to administer anything

- federal government can run the backbone directly in non-participating states

- federal funds are not threatened in an all-or-nothing way

### **Vulnerability**

Any provision that effectively threatens unrelated funding (Medicaid, CHIP, etc.) for noncompliance is NFIB-danger.

### **Hardening moves**

- Keep the "state option" purely optional.

- If you attach conditions to federal grants, make them narrow, clear, and non-catastrophic (no "lose all Medicaid funds" style leverage).

- Use the "federal backstop" model: if a state won't run it, HHS does.

## **3) Appointments Clause / preventive services (Braidwood-style risk)**

There's an ongoing line of attack arguing that certain ACA preventive coverage requirements were improper because they relied on recommendations from a body whose members weren't appointed in a constitutionally acceptable way; SCOTUS agreed to review a related case for 2025.

### **Why this matters for your plan**

Anything in ACA for the People that:

- relies on "recommended services" from an external panel, OR

- gives binding coverage effect to a body not clearly under officer/appointments structure,\
  \
  invites the same type of challenge.

### **Hardening moves**

- If you use expert panels, make them advisory.

- Require HHS (a Senate-confirmed Secretary) to formally adopt coverage rules via rulemaking.

- Alternatively, write a statutory preventive services floor and let agencies update via clear criteria.

## **4) Loper Bright / APA rulemaking vulnerability (high risk)**

This is the quiet killer. Even when Congress wins the big vote, courts can pick off rules one by one under APA review, especially post-Chevron.

### **Likely claims**

- "Statute doesn't authorize this exact rule."

- "Agency exceeded authority."

- "Insufficient record; arbitrary and capricious."

- "Failed to consider alternatives."

### **Hardening moves**

A. Write narrower delegations

- Fewer "as the Secretary determines" phrases on major issues.

- More "the Secretary shall implement X using criteria A--F."

B. Build the administrative record

- Require explicit studies, cost analyses, and public comment summaries.

- Stage rulemakings with realistic timelines.

C. Pre-authorize key standards

- Network adequacy definitions (real access, not paper networks)

- Prior authorization limits (categories)

- Rebate pass-through and spread pricing ban (clear statutory commands)

## **5) Nondelegation / "too much power to HHS"**

This Court hasn't fully revived nondelegation, but some justices are sympathetic to challenges when Congress gives agencies broad authority without intelligible principles.

### **Vulnerability**

If the backbone + affordability + enforcement all hinge on broad discretion, you get a combined major questions + nondelegation attack.

### **Hardening moves**

- Put formulas and guardrails in statute.

- Require periodic reporting to Congress.

- Use Title IX oversight as accountability, but don't rely on it to "create" policy.

## **6) ERISA preemption collisions (employer plans)**

Employer-sponsored insurance is governed by ERISA, which often preempts state laws "relating to" employer plans. Opponents can argue that certain state innovation measures or employer-related requirements are preempted.

### **Where your plan is safer**

Because ACA for the People is federal, you can avoid ERISA landmines by:

- keeping employer participation optional

- avoiding state-by-state mandates that touch self-funded employer plans

- offering a federal baseline option without requiring employers to restructure benefits

(Still: your state waiver section should explicitly acknowledge ERISA boundaries.)

## **7) Religious liberty challenges (RFRA / Free Exercise)**

Any contraception/PrEP/preventive benefit disputes can trigger RFRA/free exercise fights. The ACA already lives in that crossfire.

### **Hardening moves**

- Keep religious accommodations narrow and administrable.

- Avoid drafting that looks like "targeting religion."

- When possible, structure benefits as coverage availability rather than compelled employer provision.

# **Overall Supreme Court verdict**

### **Most likely to survive cleanly**

- A statutorily created backbone option

- Affordability caps written as clear formulas

- Drug reforms stated as direct prohibitions/requirements (pass-through, spread pricing ban)

- Administrative simplification that clearly fits HHS/CMS authorities

- Federal backstop approach to avoid NFIB-style coercion

### **Most likely to be attacked successfully if drafted loosely**

- Anything that relies on broad, ambiguous agency discretion post-Loper Bright

- Anything that gives binding effect to recommendations from bodies with questionable appointment status

- Any funding condition that looks coercive toward states

# **"Litigation-proofing" upgrades I recommend making now**

If we revise the legislative package, the highest ROI edits are:

1.  Convert affordability caps from "Secretary sets" to "Congress sets ranges + formula."

2.  Codify "real network access" standards in statute (time/distance + appointment availability concepts).

3.  Make expert panels advisory only; require Secretary adoption via rule.

4.  Explicit NFIB-safe state structure: opt-in admin only; federal fallback always.

5.  Add APA armor: required findings, cost impact statements, and structured timelines.
