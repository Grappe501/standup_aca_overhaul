# **Start Here: What This Project Is --- and Why It Matters**

## **The short version (2--3 minutes)**

Healthcare in America costs too much, covers people unevenly, and puts families one illness away from financial disaster.

The Affordable Care Act helped --- but it left too much power in the hands of insurance companies, allowed prices to keep rising, and failed to protect rural hospitals.

This project exists to fix that.

We are building a people-first overhaul of the Affordable Care Act that:

- lowers monthly premiums

- caps how much families can ever be forced to pay

- guarantees coverage for everyone

- keeps rural hospitals open

- shifts power away from insurance companies

- does not raise taxes

- and can realistically pass Congress

This is not a think piece.

This is a real policy blueprint, built in public, step by step.

## **Why this project exists**

Most Americans don't argue about healthcare in ideological terms.

They ask practical questions:

- Why is my premium so high if I still can't afford care?

- Why does insurance deny or delay treatment my doctor says I need?

- Why do hospitals close even though we're "insured"?

- Why does this system feel rigged against regular people?

Those questions are valid --- and they have answers.

The uncomfortable truth is this:

> The current system is designed to manage risk for insurance companies, not to guarantee affordable care for people.

The Affordable Care Act improved access --- but it did not change who holds power.

This project does.

## **What we mean by "shifting power away from insurance companies"**

We are not anti-business.

We are pro-people.

Insurance companies are private entities. Their responsibility is to shareholders --- not families.

Right now, the system allows insurers to:

- profit from complexity

- design plans that look affordable but aren't

- restrict networks quietly

- delay care through paperwork

- shift costs onto patients and hospitals

- survive even when care gets worse

That is not a free market.

That is rule design favoring one side.

Our approach is simple:

> If an insurance company can only make money by exploiting loopholes, those loopholes should be closed.

Private insurers can still exist.

They just don't get to run the system.

## **What this project is building**

We are designing a new healthcare backbone --- a guaranteed baseline plan that:

- is available to every American

- sets clear, fair rules

- caps what people pay

- protects rural hospitals

- forces private plans to compete honestly

- simplifies enrollment and coverage

- eliminates waste that drives costs up

Think of it like this:

> Roads, water, and electricity have public standards.
>
> Healthcare should too.

Private options can exist --- but the foundation must serve the public.

## **Our non-negotiable principles**

Every idea in this project is tested against these rules:

### **1. Affordability first**

Lower premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs --- not one or the other.

### **2. Universal and fair**

Everyone can access coverage. No gaps. No "wrong income" problems. No state-based dead ends.

### **3. Cap what families pay**

No one should face financial ruin because they got sick.

### **4. No new taxes**

We pay for reform by removing waste, overpricing, and rent extraction --- not by taxing families.

### **5. Rural hospitals survive**

If a system can't work outside major cities, it is not a national solution.

### **6. Power must move**

If a proposal lowers costs but leaves insurers in control, it fails.

### **7. It must be passable**

We build:

- a best-possible blueprint, and

- a version Congress can pass

No fantasy policy. No surrender either.

## **How this site works**

This website is built to be transparent and understandable.

You'll see:

- plain-English explanations

- real data

- side-by-side comparisons

- drafts that evolve over time

- a public change log showing what changed and why

You do not need a policy background to follow along.

Each section answers four questions:

1.  What is the problem?

2.  Who benefits from the current setup?

3.  How does it hurt people?

4.  What would we change?

## **What's coming next**

We are building this in public, in stages.

Next sections will cover:

- why healthcare costs keep rising

- how insurance companies extract profit

- why rural hospitals are failing

- what a new backbone could look like

- which loopholes drive waste

- how we lower costs without raising taxes

- what Congress could pass right now

At the end, this project will produce:

- a clear public blueprint

- a detailed policy proposal

- draft legislative language

- and an implementation roadmap

## **Who this is for**

This project is for:

- working families

- small business owners

- rural communities

- seniors

- people with chronic illness

- healthcare workers

- lawmakers who want real solutions

- anyone tired of paying more for less

You don't have to agree with everything here.

You just have to agree on one thing:

> The system should work for people --- not against them.

### **Where to go next**

- Why Healthcare Costs So Much

- How Insurance Power Works

- What We Mean by a New Backbone

We'll build those next.
