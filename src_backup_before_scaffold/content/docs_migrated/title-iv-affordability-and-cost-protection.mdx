# **Title IV --- Affordability and Cost Protection**

(Locking in real financial protection for families)

## **SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "Healthcare Affordability and Cost Protection Act."

## **SEC. 402. PURPOSE AND INTENT.**

The purpose of this title is to:

1.  ensure that health coverage is affordable in practice, not in name only;

2.  cap total financial exposure for individuals and families;

3.  eliminate plan designs that shift costs deceptively or unpredictably;

4.  protect access to essential care at the point of service; and

5.  prevent insurers from circumventing affordability protections through complexity or delay.

Congress intends that affordability protections under this title be automatic, enforceable, and uniform nationwide.

## **SEC. 403. DEFINITION OF AFFORDABILITY.**

For purposes of this title, the term "affordable coverage" means coverage under which:

1.  premium contributions are capped relative to household income;

2.  total annual out-of-pocket spending is limited by a single, comprehensive maximum; and

3.  essential services are accessible without prohibitive point-of-care costs.

Affordability shall be assessed based on total expected annual cost, not premium cost alone.

## **SEC. 404. PREMIUM AFFORDABILITY CAPS.**

### **(a) Establishment of Caps**

The Secretary shall establish income-based premium caps applicable to all plans subject to this title, including the Healthcare Backbone Plan and participating private plans.

### **(b) Uniform Application**

Premium caps shall:

1.  apply uniformly across states and markets;

2.  adjust automatically with changes in household income;

3.  eliminate affordability cliffs caused by minor income fluctuations.

### **(c) Prohibition on Circumvention**

Insurers may not increase deductibles, cost-sharing, or other charges for the purpose of offsetting premium caps.

## **SEC. 405. COMPREHENSIVE OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUMS.**

### **(a) True Annual Maximum**

The Secretary shall establish a single, comprehensive annual out-of-pocket maximum that:

1.  includes all deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and similar charges;

2.  applies to all covered essential health services;

3.  may not exclude services or categories of care through plan design.

### **(b) Prohibited Cost-Shifting**

Insurers may not:

1.  reclassify costs to avoid inclusion in the maximum;

2.  impose separate caps for different benefit categories;

3.  require additional payment for covered services after the maximum is reached.

### **(c) Automatic Enforcement**

Once an enrollee reaches the annual out-of-pocket maximum:

1.  coverage for essential services shall be provided without additional cost-sharing;

2.  no further payment may be required from the enrollee for the remainder of the plan year.

## **SEC. 406. POINT-OF-CARE COST PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) Preventive and Essential Services**

The Secretary shall ensure low or zero cost-sharing for:

1.  preventive services;

2.  chronic disease management;

3.  primary care services;

4.  mental health and substance use disorder services;

5.  maternity and newborn care.

### **(b) Predictability Requirement**

Plans shall provide clear, advance disclosure of point-of-care costs and may not impose:

1.  variable or indeterminate copayments;

2.  retroactive charges;

3.  undisclosed facility or administrative fees.

## **SEC. 407. PROHIBITION ON DECEPTIVE AFFORDABILITY PRACTICES.**

### **(a) Misleading Plan Design**

It shall be unlawful for any plan subject to this title to:

1.  market coverage as "affordable" while shifting material costs to later stages of care;

2.  rely on excessive deductibles to discourage utilization;

3.  structure benefits primarily to deter enrollment by individuals with higher medical needs.

### **(b) Enforcement**

The Secretary shall establish penalties for violations, including:

- mandatory consumer restitution;

- civil monetary penalties;

- suspension or termination of plan participation.

## **SEC. 408. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND DELAY PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) Limits on Prior Authorization**

The Secretary shall restrict the use of prior authorization to circumstances where:

1.  clinical evidence supports its necessity; and

2.  delay does not jeopardize patient health or access.

### **(b) Automatic Approval**

For chronic conditions and recurring services:

1.  approvals shall extend for a defined continuity period;

2.  repeat authorization may not be required absent clinical justification.

### **(c) Accountability**

Delays or denials that result in patient harm or increased cost shall constitute violations of this title.

## **SEC. 409. COVERAGE CONTINUITY AND GRACE PERIODS.**

### **(a) Continuous Eligibility**

Eligible individuals shall not lose coverage due solely to:

1.  temporary income fluctuations;

2.  administrative delays;

3.  documentation errors beyond the individual's control.

### **(b) Grace Periods**

The Secretary shall establish grace periods sufficient to:

- prevent unnecessary disenrollment;

- reduce coverage churn;

- maintain continuity of care.

## **SEC. 410. DATA TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC REPORTING.**

### **(a) Affordability Metrics**

The Secretary shall publish annual reports on:

- average total cost of coverage;

- out-of-pocket spending by income level;

- utilization of affordability protections.

### **(b) Public Accountability**

Plans shall disclose:

- cost-sharing structures;

- denial and delay rates;

- compliance with affordability standards.

## **SEC. 411. FUNDING AND BUDGET NEUTRALITY.**

### **(a) Funding Mechanisms**

This title shall be implemented using:

1.  savings from reduced administrative waste;

2.  price discipline resulting from standardized rules;

3.  reductions in unnecessary utilization caused by delayed care.

### **(b) No New Taxes**

Nothing in this title authorizes new federal taxes, fees, or individual mandates.

## **SEC. 412. RULEMAKING AND EFFECTIVE DATES.**

### **(a) Rulemaking Authority**

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out this title.

### **(b) Phased Implementation**

Affordability protections may be phased in to:

- allow administrative readiness;

- avoid disruption;

- prioritize high-cost and underserved markets.

## **SEC. 413. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why Title IV matters**

This title:

- makes affordability real, not rhetorical;

- removes insurer escape hatches;

- protects families automatically;

- reduces long-term system costs;

- and reinforces the backbone established in Title III.

Together, Titles III and IV form the irreducible core of ACA for the People.
