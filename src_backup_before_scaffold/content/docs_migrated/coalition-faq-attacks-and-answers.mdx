## **Coalition FAQ --- Attacks & Answers**

(Use freely. Share widely. Keep answers short and confident.)

## **"Isn't this just single-payer in disguise?"**

No.

- Private insurance continues to exist.

- No one is forced onto a government plan.

- Employers can still offer coverage.

- People can keep private plans if they want.

What changes is who sets the rules.

This proposal creates a public baseline that private insurers must compete against --- instead of letting them control the system.

## **"Does this raise taxes?"**

No.

The proposal explicitly prohibits new taxes.

It is funded by:

- closing insurance loopholes,

- reducing administrative waste,

- lowering drug prices,

- and cutting inflated costs that currently drive subsidies.

Lower prices mean lower public spending, not higher taxes.

## **"How do you pay for all this?"**

By stopping money from leaking out of the system.

Savings come from:

- ending profit-through-delay and denial,

- banning middleman pricing games,

- reducing paperwork and billing waste,

- stabilizing coverage to reduce emergency care,

- and enforcing real competition.

This is cost control, not new spending.

## **"Won't this kill private insurance?"**

No --- but it ends unfair advantages.

Private insurers can:

- compete with the backbone plan, or

- offer supplemental coverage.

They just can't:

- profit from confusion,

- delay care to save money,

- or design junk plans.

If an insurer can't compete honestly, that's not a public failure.

## **"Won't doctors and hospitals get paid less?"**

No.

In fact:

- payment becomes more predictable,

- administrative burden drops,

- and rural hospitals are stabilized.

Providers are paid for:

- access,

- readiness,

- and continuity --- not paperwork volume.

This improves provider finances without driving prices up.

## **"Won't rural hospitals close faster?"**

No --- this proposal is designed specifically to stop that.

It:

- reduces uncompensated care,

- provides access-based payments,

- stabilizes essential services like ER and maternity care,

- lowers administrative costs,

- and keeps decision-making local.

The current system is what's killing rural hospitals.

## **"Does this ration care?"**

No.

It:

- expands access,

- reduces delays,

- limits prior authorization abuse,

- and makes care affordable when people need it.

Rationing happens now --- through cost, delay, and denial.

This proposal removes those barriers.

## **"Won't wait times get worse?"**

No.

Wait times increase when:

- people delay care until emergencies,

- providers are overwhelmed by paperwork,

- access is uneven.

This proposal:

- encourages early care,

- simplifies systems,

- and stabilizes provider staffing.

That reduces bottlenecks, not increases them.

## **"Isn't this too complicated?"**

Actually, it makes healthcare simpler.

- Standardized plans

- Clear cost caps

- Fewer forms

- Fewer eligibility cliffs

- Fewer billing disputes

The current system is complicated by design.

This proposal removes that complexity.

## **"Why not just expand subsidies?"**

Because subsidies alone:

- prop up high prices,

- increase public spending,

- and don't fix power imbalances.

This proposal lowers prices first, then lets subsidies shrink naturally.

## **"Can this really pass Congress?"**

Yes --- because it's designed to.

- It builds on existing law.

- It phases implementation.

- It avoids new taxes.

- It protects rural districts.

- It uses regulatory authority strategically.

This is governing reform, not messaging reform.

## **"Who opposes this?"**

Primarily:

- large insurance companies,

- PBMs that profit from opacity,

- and actors benefiting from the current system's complexity.

Opposition is concentrated, not broad.

## **"Who supports this?"**

Naturally appeals to:

- working families,

- rural communities,

- healthcare workers,

- small businesses,

- seniors,

- people with chronic conditions,

- and budget-conscious policymakers.

This is a cross-partisan affordability reform.

## **"What's the simplest way to explain this?"**

> We fixed the rules so healthcare works for people instead of insurance companies.

That's it.

## **Coalition message discipline (important)**

When talking about this proposal:

- Lead with cost and affordability

- Emphasize no new taxes

- Highlight rural hospital survival

- Avoid ideological labels

- Frame it as fixing what's broken, not replacing everything

## **Bottom line for partners**

ACA for the People:

- lowers costs,

- protects families,

- stabilizes care,

- and restores trust.

It is serious, fair, and ready.
