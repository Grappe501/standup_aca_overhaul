# **Bad Administration Scenario**

## **How ACA for the People performs under hostile executive control**

## **Baseline assumption**

- Congress passes ACA for the People.

- Titles III--IX are law.

- A new administration is elected that:

  - dislikes the policy,

  - does not repeal it,

  - but seeks to weaken it through neglect, delay, or selective enforcement.

This is historically common.

## **I. What a hostile administration** 

## **cannot easily undo**

These are the structural anchors --- they survive even bad faith.

### **1ï¸âƒ£ The healthcare backbone (if statutorily explicit)**

If the backbone is:

- created directly by statute,

- with defined eligibility, benefits, and affordability caps,

Then:

- HHS cannot eliminate it without Congress

- Courts will enforce statutory commands

- The plan remains available even if under-promoted

Risk level under hostile admin: Low

Survival likelihood: High

ðŸ”’ Key requirement:

Backbone fundamentals must live in the statute, not only in regulation.

### **2ï¸âƒ£ Affordability caps written into law**

If premium caps and out-of-pocket limits are:

- numerical or formula-based in statute,

- not merely "as the Secretary determines",

Then:

- insurers must comply regardless of enforcement enthusiasm

- courts can enforce compliance via private action

- public backlash occurs quickly if caps are ignored

Risk level: Low

Survival likelihood: Very high

ðŸ”’ This is one of the strongest parts of the plan.

### **3ï¸âƒ£ Drug rebate pass-through & spread pricing bans**

These work because:

- they are clear prohibitions, not discretionary programs

- compliance is mechanical and auditable

- violations are visible at the pharmacy counter

A hostile administration can:

- slow guidance,\
  \
  but cannot:

- re-legalize spread pricing

- hide point-of-sale prices

Risk level: Low--Medium

Survival likelihood: High

### **4ï¸âƒ£ Federal fallback if states refuse**

If states opt out:

- HHS must step in

A hostile administration might:

- underfund outreach,

- slow staffing,

But:

- courts can compel action

- affected parties have standing

- Congress can force appropriations clarity

Risk level: Medium

Survival likelihood: Medium--High

## **II. What a hostile administration can** 

## **slow, weaken, or starve**

These are the soft underbellies.

### **5ï¸âƒ£ Enforcement intensity (the biggest risk)**

A hostile administration can:

- deprioritize investigations

- interpret standards narrowly

- delay penalty assessments

- settle violations quietly

This is how reforms usually die.

Risk level: High

Survival likelihood without safeguards: Medium

ðŸ”§ Mitigations already included

- Automatic penalties

- Mandatory reporting

- Oversight Commission

- Whistleblower protections

- Citizen enforcement pathways

ðŸ”§ Additional hardening recommended

- Statutory deadlines for enforcement actions

- Required public explanations for non-enforcement

- Private right of action for specific violations

### **6ï¸âƒ£ Rulemaking pace (APA slow-walk)**

A hostile HHS can:

- delay rules

- reopen comment periods

- issue minimal guidance

- invite litigation through sloppy records

Risk level: Medium--High

ðŸ”§ Mitigation

- Statutory implementation deadlines

- Default rules if deadlines missed

- Clear congressional findings to support courts

### **7ï¸âƒ£ Outreach & public education**

Administrations control:

- messaging

- enrollment outreach

- public awareness

A hostile administration can:

- confuse people

- under-advertise benefits

- frame the law negatively

Risk level: Medium

But impact is limited if benefits are automatic

ðŸ”§ Mitigation

- Automatic enrollment pathways

- Price reductions people feel directly (drugs, caps)

- State and civil society amplification

## **III. What a hostile administration is** 

## **unlikely to reverse politically**

These become too visible to touch.

### **8ï¸âƒ£ Drug price drops**

Once people experience:

- lower pharmacy prices,

- fewer rebate games,

Rolling that back is politically radioactive.

Durability: Very high

### **9ï¸âƒ£ Rural hospital stabilization**

Once rural hospitals stop closing:

- members of Congress notice

- local media notices

- governors notice

A hostile administration would struggle to justify reversing this.

Durability: High

### **ðŸ”Ÿ Simpler insurance experience**

When people experience:

- fewer denials,

- faster approvals,

- clearer costs,

Even a hostile administration risks backlash if it allows regression.

Durability: Medium--High

## **IV. The hard truth**

> No healthcare reform is administration-proof.

But ACA for the People is administration-resistant because:

- it front-loads benefits people feel

- it embeds rules in statute

- it reduces discretion where abuse is likely

- it allows courts and citizens to enforce

- it makes rollback visible and unpopular

## **V. The single most important durability lesson**

If one thing determines survival under a bad administration, it is this:

### **Do not rely on agency goodwill.**

Rely on:

- statutory formulas,

- automatic triggers,

- deadlines,

- public transparency,

- and enforceable rights.

Your plan already leans this way --- which is why it holds up better than most reforms.

## **Final stress-test verdict**

Under a hostile administration:

- âŒ The plan may not reach full potential quickly

- âŒ Enforcement may be uneven

- âŒ Rollout may be slower

But:

- âœ… Core affordability survives

- âœ… Drug savings persist

- âœ… Backbone availability endures

- âœ… Rural stabilization largely holds

- âœ… Rollback becomes politically risky

That is real durability.

## **Where this leaves us**

You have now stress-tested:

- politics,

- courts,

- markets,

- insurers,

- and hostile executives.

What remains is implementation discipline, not conceptual risk.
