# **ACA for the People**

### **A healthcare overhaul built for regular Americans --- not insurance companies**

Healthcare in the United States costs too much, covers people unevenly, and leaves families exposed even when they're insured.

The Affordable Care Act helped --- but it left the system's power structure intact.

ACA for the People fixes that.

This project builds a new healthcare backbone that:

- lowers premiums and out-of-pocket costs

- caps what families can ever be forced to pay

- guarantees coverage everywhere

- keeps rural hospitals open

- shifts power away from insurance companies

- does not raise taxes

- and can realistically pass Congress

This work is being built in public, step by step.

ðŸ‘‰ Start Here: What This Project Is --- and Why It Matters

A plain-English overview of the problem, the solution, and why this is different.

## **The problem (understand the system)**

Before you can fix healthcare, you have to understand why it's broken.

- Why Healthcare Costs So Much\
  \
  How prices rise, waste spreads, and families pay the price.

- How Insurance Companies Hold Power\
  \
  Why delay, denial, and confusion are profitable --- and how the rules allow it.

- Why Rural Hospitals Are Failing\
  \
  Why coverage expansion wasn't enough --- and what actually keeps care local.

## **The solution (how we fix it)**

This project doesn't tweak around the edges. It rebuilds the foundation.

- What Is a New Healthcare Backbone?\
  \
  A universal baseline plan that sets fair rules for everyone.

- Backbone Options Compared\
  \
  Public option vs buy-in vs hybrid --- what works, what doesn't, and what can pass.

- Affordability Caps\
  \
  How we protect families from medical debt without raising taxes.

- Paying for Care & Stabilizing Rural Hospitals\
  \
  How providers are paid fairly without driving costs back up.

## **Closing the loopholes (where savings come from)**

Lower costs don't come from cuts --- they come from removing waste.

- Insurance Loopholes\
  \
  How profit is extracted --- and how we close the escape hatches.

- Administrative Simplification\
  \
  How cutting paperwork lowers costs and burnout.

- Prescription Drug Reform\
  \
  How drug prices fall when middleman games end.

## **The law (this is real)**

This project doesn't stop at ideas.

We've drafted:

- a full legislative blueprint,

- section-by-section bill language,

- and a realistic path through Congress.

- Executive Summary

- Full Blueprint

- How This Passes Congress

## **What this means for you**

Every major section has a plain-English explainer:

- What Title III Means for You

- What Title IV Means for You

- What Title V Means for You

- What Title VI Means for You

- What Title VII Means for You

- What Title VIII Means for You

- What Title IX Means for You

No jargon. No spin. Just consequences.

## **Why we're building this in public**

Healthcare reform usually fails because:

- deals happen behind closed doors,

- complexity hides accountability,

- and people don't trust the system.

We're doing the opposite.

Every page, change, and decision is documented.

You can follow the thinking.

You can challenge assumptions.

You can see what changed and why.

## **Who this is for**

This project is for:

- working families

- rural communities

- small business owners

- healthcare workers

- people with chronic conditions

- anyone tired of paying more for less

You don't have to agree with every detail to agree on this:

> Healthcare should work for people --- not against them.

## **What's next**

We are continuing to build:

- a one-page congressional handout,

- coalition-facing materials,

- visual explainers,

- and public feedback pathways.

This is a living project --- not a press release.
