# **Insurance Loopholes: How Profit Is Extracted**

(And how we close them without raising taxes)

Paste into:

/loopholes/insurer-loopholes.html

## **The short version (2--3 minutes)**

Insurance companies do not primarily make money by providing better healthcare.

They make money by:

- exploiting complexity,

- shifting costs onto patients and providers,

- and operating inside loopholes written into the system.

These loopholes are not accidental.

They are structural --- and they are fixable.

Closing them is how we:

- lower costs,

- improve care,

- stabilize hospitals,

- and fund reform without raising taxes.

## **A necessary clarification**

This page is not about demonizing insurance companies.

It's about rules.

Private companies will always follow incentives.

If the rules reward delay, confusion, and cost-shifting --- that is what the system will produce.

> Fixing healthcare means fixing the rules, not arguing about motives.

## **Loophole #1: "Affordable" plans that aren't affordable**

Under current rules, a plan can be labeled "affordable" even if:

- the deductible is thousands of dollars

- care is unaffordable until late in the year

- families avoid treatment to save money

This allows insurers to:

- advertise low premiums

- shift real costs to the moment care is needed

- appear compliant while delivering little value

Result:

People are "insured" but still can't afford care.

Fix direction:

Affordability must include total expected cost, not just premiums.

## **Loophole #2: Prior authorization as a cost-control weapon**

Prior authorization is presented as a medical safeguard.

In reality, it is often used to:

- delay care

- deny care initially

- wear down providers

- reduce utilization through friction

Even when care is eventually approved, delay alone saves insurers money.

Result:

Patients suffer. Providers burn out. Insurers profit.

Fix direction:

Limit prior authorization to narrow, evidence-based uses --- or eliminate it where abuse is documented.

## **Loophole #3: Narrow networks by design**

Insurers restrict networks to:

- exclude high-cost providers

- negotiate lower payments

- deter people who need specialized care

Patients often discover network limits:

- after enrollment

- during emergencies

- when bills arrive

Result:

Less access, surprise costs, fragmented care.

Fix direction:

Stronger network adequacy rules tied to real access --- not paper compliance.

## **Loophole #4: Churn without accountability**

People move in and out of coverage constantly due to:

- income changes

- job changes

- paperwork issues

- eligibility technicalities

Insurers benefit because:

- long-term health outcomes don't matter

- high-cost patients often leave

- care coordination becomes unnecessary

Result:

No one is responsible for long-term health.

Fix direction:

Stable coverage and enrollment continuity --- especially through a public backbone.

## **Loophole #5: Complexity that hides responsibility**

Healthcare insurance is deliberately hard to understand.

Complexity:

- discourages consumer comparison

- hides who is responsible

- weakens enforcement

- protects profit margins

The harder a system is to explain, the harder it is to reform.

Result:

People blame themselves --- not the structure.

Fix direction:

Standardized plans, simple rules, clear accountability.

## **Loophole #6: Weak enforcement of consumer protections**

Many existing protections are:

- under-enforced

- poorly audited

- inconsistently applied

Insurers often face:

- minimal penalties

- delayed consequences

- limited public scrutiny

Result:

Rules exist on paper but not in practice.

Fix direction:

Automatic enforcement, transparency, and real penalties for abuse.

## **The bigger picture: why subsidies alone don't work**

When loopholes remain open:

- subsidies flow into inflated prices

- insurers adapt to capture them

- costs continue rising

This is why:

- premiums rise even with subsidies

- out-of-pocket costs remain high

- public spending increases without relief

> Subsidies without structural reform are a blank check.

## **Why closing loopholes doesn't raise taxes**

Closing insurer loopholes:

- reduces waste

- lowers prices

- improves efficiency

- stabilizes risk pools

Every dollar not extracted through gaming:

- lowers premiums

- reduces federal subsidy costs

- strengthens provider stability

This is how reform pays for itself.

## **The takeaway**

Insurance companies didn't break healthcare.

The rules allowed them to extract value without accountability.

If we want:

- lower costs,

- fair access,

- and a system that works for people,

then loopholes must close --- and power must shift.

## **What comes next**

Insurance loopholes are only one part of the problem.

Next, we confront:

- why rural hospitals are failing

- and how a new backbone keeps them alive

Because affordability means nothing if care disappears.

TgSay "Move forward" and I'll draft the rural hospitals page next.
