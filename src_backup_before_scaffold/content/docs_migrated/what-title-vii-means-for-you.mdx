## **What Title VII Means for You**

### **Lower drug prices, fewer games, and no more paying twice**

(Plain-English explainer for the Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act)

## **The short version (2 minutes)**

Title VII lowers prescription drug costs by cutting out middleman games --- not by rationing medicine or telling doctors what they can prescribe.

It makes sure:

- discounts actually reach you,

- prices make sense,

- and no one profits by inflating costs behind the scenes.

If you've ever wondered why your medication is expensive even when there's a "rebate," this is why --- and this is how it stops.

## **The problem this fixes**

Most people assume high drug prices are only about drug companies.

That's only part of the story.

In reality:

- prices are negotiated in secret,

- middlemen take cuts you never see,

- rebates reward higher list prices,

- and you pay based on the inflated price --- not the discounted one.

So even when "savings" exist, you don't get them.

## **What Title VII changes --- clearly and directly**

## **1ï¸âƒ£ Discounts and rebates go straight to you**

Today:

- drug companies give rebates,

- middlemen keep them,

- insurers use them to lower premiums on paper,

- and you still pay high prices at the counter.

Under Title VII:

- every discount and rebate is applied at the pharmacy

- your copay is based on the real price

- savings show up when you need them --- not later

You stop paying inflated prices for drugs that are already discounted.

## **2ï¸âƒ£ Spread pricing is banned**

Spread pricing means:

- the middleman charges your plan one price,

- pays the pharmacy a lower price,

- and pockets the difference.

You never see it --- but you pay for it.

Title VII:

- bans spread pricing,

- requires transparent, fee-based payment,

- and stops hidden markups.

If someone makes money in the drug system, it has to be earned openly.

## **3ï¸âƒ£ Formularies can't be designed to hurt patients**

Formularies decide which drugs are covered and how much you pay.

Right now, they're often designed to:

- maximize rebates,

- push higher-priced drugs,

- raise your out-of-pocket costs.

Title VII requires:

- clear disclosure of how drugs are chosen,

- proof that decisions aren't based on profit over patients,

- protection from being steered to costlier drugs without medical reason.

Your treatment plan stops being a financial chess piece.

## **4ï¸âƒ£ Price hikes have to be explained**

Title VII doesn't set prices --- but it forces accountability.

When prices jump:

- companies must explain why,

- increases are made public,

- patterns are visible to regulators and the public.

Sunlight doesn't fix everything --- but it stops abuse from hiding.

## **5ï¸âƒ£ Generics and biosimilars get real support**

Lower-cost alternatives often exist --- but are blocked.

Title VII:

- cracks down on tactics that delay competition,

- speeds access to generics and biosimilars,

- prevents contracts that lock out cheaper options.

Competition works when it's allowed to exist.

## **6ï¸âƒ£ Independent and rural pharmacies are protected**

Small pharmacies are being squeezed out by hidden fees and clawbacks.

Title VII:

- bans retroactive fees,

- ensures fair reimbursement,

- keeps local pharmacies viable,

- protects access in rural and underserved areas.

When pharmacies close, care disappears.

This stops that.

## **What this means when you go to the pharmacy**

- Lower prices at the counter

- Fewer surprises

- Less time arguing over coverage

- More predictable monthly costs

- Fewer skipped doses due to cost

Medicine becomes something you can actually afford to take.

## **Does this reduce access to drugs?**

No.

Title VII:

- does not limit what doctors can prescribe,

- does not ration medications,

- does not restrict treatment options.

It removes price manipulation, not care.

## **Does this raise taxes?**

No.

Savings come from:

- eliminating hidden markups,

- reducing inflated list prices,

- lowering subsidy spending tied to drug costs.

Less waste = less spending.

## **The bottom line**

Title VII does something overdue:

> It makes drug prices honest.

You stop paying inflated prices so others can profit quietly.

Lower prices.

Clear rules.

No middleman games.
