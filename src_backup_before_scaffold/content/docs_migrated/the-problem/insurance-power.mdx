# **How Insurance Companies Hold Power**

(And why real reform has to confront it)

## **The short version (2--3 minutes)**

Insurance companies don't control healthcare because they are better at delivering care.

They control it because:

- the rules favor them,

- complexity protects them,

- and no real alternative exists to keep them honest.

The Affordable Care Act regulated some of their worst behavior --- but it did not remove their control over the system.

If we want lower costs and real security, that has to change.

## **What insurance is supposed to do --- and what it actually does**

In theory, insurance exists to:

- spread risk,

- guarantee access to care,

- protect people from financial catastrophe.

In practice, most private insurance companies focus on:

- managing payouts,

- avoiding high-cost patients,

- delaying care,

- shifting costs,

- and designing plans that look affordable but aren't.

That isn't because insurers are uniquely bad actors.

It's because the system rewards this behavior.

## **Power mechanism #1: Control over plan design**

Insurance companies decide:

- what services are covered

- when they are covered

- how much you must pay before coverage kicks in

- which doctors and hospitals count

- what hoops must be jumped through first

Two plans can have the same premium and wildly different real-world value.

This allows insurers to:

- attract healthy enrollees,

- discourage people who need care,

- advertise low prices while hiding future costs.

The ACA tried to standardize plans --- but not enough to prevent gaming.

## **Power mechanism #2: Prior authorization and delay**

One of the strongest tools insurers use is delay.

Prior authorization allows insurers to:

- require approval before care is provided

- deny first and force appeals

- exhaust providers and patients

- quietly reduce utilization

This shifts decision-making power:

- away from doctors

- away from patients

- toward insurance administrators

Delays save money --- even when care is eventually approved.

## **Power mechanism #3: Narrow networks**

Insurers often limit which doctors and hospitals are "in network."

This allows them to:

- negotiate lower payments

- avoid expensive providers

- shift costs onto patients unknowingly

For patients, it means:

- fewer choices

- longer travel times

- surprise bills

- fragmented care

Narrow networks are often not obvious until care is needed --- when it's too late.

## **Power mechanism #4: Churn as a business model**

People frequently move between:

- Medicaid

- Marketplace plans

- employer coverage

- uninsured status

This is called churn.

Churn benefits insurers because:

- long-term health outcomes don't matter

- high-cost patients often leave

- care coordination becomes unnecessary

- accountability disappears

When coverage is unstable, insurers don't have to invest in people's health.

## **Power mechanism #5: Complexity as protection**

Healthcare in the U.S. is confusing on purpose.

Complexity:

- discourages comparison shopping

- overwhelms patients

- hides responsibility

- limits public accountability

The more confusing the system is, the harder it is to regulate --- and the easier it is to defend the status quo.

> Confusion is not accidental.
>
> It is structural protection.

## **Power mechanism #6: Weak competition**

In many markets, people have:

- one or two insurers to choose from

- no meaningful alternative

- no public option to fall back on

That isn't a market.

That's managed dependence.

Without a credible baseline option:

- insurers set the terms

- prices drift upward

- consumers absorb the risk

## **Why the ACA didn't break this power**

The ACA:

- banned discrimination against sick people

- required minimum benefit standards

- expanded subsidies

- regulated some pricing behavior

But it still:

- relied on private insurers to run the system

- subsidized high prices rather than lowering them

- allowed plan complexity to persist

- left no universal fallback option

In short:

> The ACA regulated insurance companies --- but it didn't replace their dominance.

## **Why this matters for cost**

As long as insurers control:

- plan design

- access rules

- reimbursement dynamics

- and administrative complexity

Costs will rise --- no matter how many subsidies exist.

Subsidies help people afford a broken system.

They don't fix the system.

## **The core insight**

If insurance companies remain the central organizing force of healthcare, then:

- care will be delayed

- costs will be shifted

- complexity will grow

- rural hospitals will struggle

- and people will remain exposed

Real reform does not require eliminating private insurance.

It requires ending their control over the foundation.

## **What comes next**

The solution is not more regulation layered on top of a weak structure.

The solution is a new backbone:

- simple

- universal

- fair

- affordable

- and strong enough to force honest competition

That's where we go next.
