# **Why Healthcare Costs So Much**

(And why it isn't because Americans use "too much care")

## **The short version (2--3 minutes)**

Healthcare in the United States is expensive by design, not by accident.

We don't pay more because Americans are sicker, older, or greedier than people in other countries. We pay more because:

- prices are largely unchecked

- insurance companies profit from complexity

- hospitals are forced to overcharge to survive

- middlemen extract value without improving care

- and the system rewards paperwork, not health

The result is a system where everyone pays more, but no one feels protected.

## **A simple truth most debates avoid**

When people talk about healthcare costs, they often argue about:

- "government vs private"

- "socialism vs capitalism"

- "personal responsibility"

Those arguments miss the real issue.

> Healthcare costs rise because the rules allow powerful actors to charge more without delivering more.

This project starts by following the money.

## **Where your healthcare dollar actually goes**

When you pay a premium, a copay, or a bill, that money is divided roughly into five buckets:

1.  Care delivery\
    \
    Doctors, nurses, hospitals, clinics, equipment.

2.  Insurance administration\
    \
    Claims processing, marketing, profit, executive pay.

3.  Provider pricing power\
    \
    High hospital and specialist prices --- especially in markets with little competition.

4.  Drug pricing and middlemen\
    \
    Manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), rebates, and spread pricing.

5.  Administrative waste\
    \
    Billing complexity, paperwork, denials, rework, eligibility churn.

In a healthy system, most dollars go to #1.

In the U.S. system, too much money leaks into #2--#5.

## **The myth: "Healthcare is expensive because people overuse it"**

This is one of the most common --- and most misleading --- explanations.

Yes, unnecessary care exists.

But it is not the primary driver of cost.

What actually drives cost:

- prices, not volume

- consolidation, not demand

- incentives, not behavior

Americans do not see doctors dramatically more often than people in other developed countries.

They just get charged more each time they do.

## **The insurance problem: profit from complexity**

Insurance companies do not primarily make money by keeping people healthy.

They make money by:

- designing plans that look affordable but shift costs later

- denying or delaying care through prior authorization

- narrowing networks to reduce payouts

- exploiting confusing enrollment rules

- benefiting from constant plan switching ("churn")

- managing risk --- not guaranteeing care

Complexity is not a flaw of the system.

> Complexity is the business model.

The more confusing healthcare is, the harder it is for consumers to push back --- and the easier it is for insurers to extract value.

## **The hospital problem: overcharge or die**

Hospitals, especially rural hospitals, are trapped.

They face:

- low public reimbursement rates

- high administrative burden

- insurer payment delays and denials

- shrinking patient bases

- rising labor and supply costs

To survive, many hospitals are forced to:

- charge high prices to privately insured patients

- add facility fees

- merge with larger systems

- cut unprofitable services (like maternity care)

This is why:

- insured patients still get shocking bills

- rural hospitals close even when communities have coverage

- healthcare workers burn out

Hospitals are not villains --- they are reacting to a broken payment environment.

## **The drug and middleman problem: money without medicine**

Prescription drug prices are not driven only by research costs.

They are inflated by:

- opaque rebate systems

- middlemen taking spreads

- formularies designed around profit, not outcomes

- lack of true price competition

- pricing strategies disconnected from production cost

Much of this money never improves care.

It simply changes hands.

## **Administrative waste: the invisible tax on care**

The U.S. healthcare system runs on paperwork.

Examples include:

- multiple billing codes for the same service

- repeated eligibility checks

- prior authorization ping-pong

- appeals processes that exhaust patients and providers

- coverage terminations due to technical errors

This waste:

- raises costs

- delays care

- burns out staff

- pushes people out of coverage

It functions like a hidden tax, paid not to the government --- but to inefficiency.

## **Why the ACA helped --- but didn't solve this**

The Affordable Care Act:

- expanded coverage

- banned denial for preexisting conditions

- set basic consumer protections

- reduced the uninsured rate

But it did not change the power structure.

It left:

- insurers in charge of plan design

- prices largely uncontrolled

- hospitals dependent on cross-subsidization

- rural systems vulnerable

- complexity intact

The ACA improved access --- but it didn't fix the engine.

## **The takeaway**

Healthcare costs are high because:

- powerful actors can charge more without consequence

- complexity protects profits

- people bear risk while corporations manage it

- and there is no strong public backbone enforcing fair rules

Lowering costs requires more than subsidies.

> It requires changing who the system is built to serve.

That's what this project does next.
