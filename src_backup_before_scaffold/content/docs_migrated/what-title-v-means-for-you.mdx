## **What Title V Means for You**

### **Ending delay, denial, and confusion as a business model**

(Plain-English explainer for the Insurance Accountability and Market Fairness Act)

## **The short version (2 minutes)**

Title V stops insurance companies from making money by:

- delaying your care,

- denying treatment your doctor says you need,

- confusing you with fine print,

- or wearing you down with paperwork.

It doesn't ban private insurance.

It forces insurance to do what it's supposed to do:

pay for care --- not block it.

## **The problem this fixes**

Most people don't fight insurance companies because they want to.

They fight them because they have to.

People experience:

- care delayed for weeks or months,

- treatments denied until appealed,

- endless prior authorization requests,

- narrow networks discovered too late,

- coverage rules that change mid-year,

- denials that magically reverse after pressure.

This isn't bad luck.

> It's a business strategy built into the rules.

## **What Title V changes --- in plain terms**

Title V rewrites the rules insurers must follow.

## **1ï¸âƒ£ Insurance plans must be simple and comparable**

Right now, plans are designed to confuse.

Under Title V:

- plans must follow standardized designs,

- costs are presented the same way everywhere,

- insurers can't hide costs in creative structures,

- you can compare plans side-by-side and understand them.

Insurance stops being a guessing game.

## **2ï¸âƒ£ Networks must actually work in real life**

Today, insurers can claim a "network" exists even if:

- doctors aren't taking patients,

- appointments are months away,

- specialists are unreachable,

- hospitals are hours away.

Title V says:

- networks must provide real access, not just names on a list,

- rural hospitals and essential providers must be included,

- mental health and maternity care must be accessible,

- paper compliance is no longer enough.

If care isn't available, the plan is not acceptable.

## **3ï¸âƒ£ Prior authorization can't be used to wear you down**

Prior authorization is one of the most hated parts of insurance --- for patients and doctors alike.

Under Title V:

- insurers can't require approval for routine, proven care,

- chronic conditions don't require repeated re-approval,

- delays that harm patients count as violations,

- denial and delay rates must be publicly reported.

If your doctor says you need it, insurers need a real reason to say no.

## **4ï¸âƒ£ Insurers can't profit from delay or denial**

This is one of the most important changes.

Title V makes it illegal for insurers to:

- benefit financially from slowing care,

- rely on people giving up,

- deny first and approve later as a tactic,

- design systems to reduce use through frustration.

If delay causes harm or higher costs later, the insurer is accountable.

## **5ï¸âƒ£ Real penalties when insurers break the rules**

Today, enforcement is weak.

Under Title V:

- violations trigger automatic penalties,

- consumers are repaid when harmed,

- repeat offenders face escalating consequences,

- plans can lose the right to participate.

Breaking the rules stops being a cost of doing business.

## **What this means for you when you're sick**

- Fewer surprise denials

- Faster approvals

- Less paperwork

- More trust in your doctor's judgment

- Less time fighting insurance

- Less stress during already stressful moments

Insurance becomes support --- not an obstacle.

## **What this means for doctors and hospitals**

Doctors and nurses:

- spend less time on paperwork,

- get paid more reliably,

- can focus on patients instead of appeals.

Rural hospitals:

- face fewer payment delays,

- have more predictable revenue,

- aren't punished for serving complex patients.

This improves care without increasing costs.

## **Does this eliminate private insurance?**

No.

Private insurers still:

- offer plans,

- compete for customers,

- provide supplemental coverage.

What they can't do anymore is:

> run healthcare through confusion and control.

## **Why this lowers costs**

When insurers can't:

- delay care,

- deny services,

- or shift costs deceptively,

then:

- people get care earlier,

- emergencies decrease,

- administrative waste drops,

- and total spending falls.

Fighting insurance is expensive.

Removing the fight saves money.

## **The bottom line**

Title V does something long overdue:

> It takes power away from insurance companies and gives it back to patients and doctors.

Care decisions return to where they belong --- the exam room.
