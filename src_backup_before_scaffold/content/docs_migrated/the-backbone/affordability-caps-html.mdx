# **Affordability Caps: How We Protect Families From Financial Ruin**

(Lower premiums, lower deductibles, real limits --- without raising taxes)

Paste into:

/the-backbone/affordability-caps.html

## **The short version (3 minutes)**

Healthcare is not affordable if people:

- skip care,

- delay treatment,

- or go into debt when they get sick.

True affordability means predictability and protection.

A people-first healthcare system must:

- limit what families pay each month,

- limit what families pay each year,

- and make those limits clear and enforceable.

This page explains how we do that --- without raising taxes.

## **The core principle**

> No one should face financial ruin because they got sick.

That principle sounds obvious.

The current system violates it every day.

Affordability caps are how we make that principle real.

## **The problem with "affordable" healthcare today**

Today, a plan can be called "affordable" even if:

- the deductible is several thousand dollars,

- care is unaffordable until late in the year,

- families avoid treatment to save money,

- out-of-pocket costs reset every January.

This creates a system where:

- insurance looks cheap,

- care is expensive,

- and illness becomes a financial crisis.

Affordability must be defined by total cost, not marketing labels.

## **What affordability caps actually mean**

Under a people-first backbone, affordability caps apply in three places:

1.  Monthly premiums

2.  Annual out-of-pocket spending

3.  Point-of-care costs

All three matter.

Capping only one does not protect families.

## **1ï¸âƒ£ Premium caps: predictable monthly costs**

Premiums must be tied to ability to pay, not market power.

A people-first backbone:

- caps premiums as a percentage of income

- applies the same rules everywhere

- eliminates sudden spikes due to market changes

- removes "cliff effects" when income changes slightly

This ensures:

- stable budgeting

- fewer coverage losses

- less churn

Premiums become a known, manageable expense --- not a gamble.

## **2ï¸âƒ£ Out-of-pocket caps: real financial protection**

Out-of-pocket costs are where families are hit hardest.

A backbone must:

- set a true annual maximum

- apply it consistently

- include deductibles, copays, and coinsurance

- prevent loopholes that shift costs outside the cap

Once a family reaches the cap:

- care is fully covered

- no surprises

- no fine print

This is how insurance is supposed to work.

## **3ï¸âƒ£ Point-of-care affordability: care when you need it**

Even with caps, people avoid care if:

- they can't afford the visit today

- the bill is unpredictable

- they fear hidden costs

A people-first system ensures:

- low or zero cost for essential care

- predictable copays

- no financial penalty for preventive or chronic care

This lowers long-term costs by encouraging early treatment.

## **Why affordability caps lower total system cost**

Affordability caps don't just help families --- they improve the system.

They:

- reduce emergency care caused by delayed treatment

- stabilize risk pools

- lower uncompensated care

- improve health outcomes

- reduce administrative complexity

When people can afford care, the system spends less overall.

## **How we pay for affordability without raising taxes**

Affordability caps are funded by:

- closing insurer loopholes

- reducing administrative waste

- lowering prices through competition

- stabilizing coverage

- eliminating cost-shifting

When prices fall:

- subsidies fall

- public spending becomes more efficient

- families save money

This is not new spending --- it is better spending.

## **Why this requires a new backbone**

Affordability caps only work if:

- rules are universal

- enforcement is automatic

- insurers can't design around them

A fragmented system can't guarantee protection.

A backbone can.

## **What this means for real people**

Under a people-first system:

- families know what they'll pay

- illness doesn't mean bankruptcy

- coverage feels like protection, not paperwork

- healthcare becomes usable --- not just nominal

This is what insurance is supposed to feel like.

## **The takeaway**

Affordability is not a slogan.

It is a structure.

Without caps:

- costs rise,

- families suffer,

- and reform fails.

With them:

- people are protected,

- care improves,

- and the system stabilizes.

## **What comes next**

Affordability protects families --- but payment design keeps the system running.

Next, we explain:

- how providers are paid

- how rural hospitals are stabilized

- and how access is guaranteed without driving prices back up
