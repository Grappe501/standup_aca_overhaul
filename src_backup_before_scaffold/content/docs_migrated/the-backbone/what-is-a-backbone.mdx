# **What Is a New Healthcare Backbone?**

(And how it changes everything without raising taxes)

## **The short version (2--3 minutes)**

A healthcare backbone is the foundation the system rests on.

Right now, America doesn't have one.

Instead, we have a patchwork of private insurance plans that:

- set their own rules,

- shift costs onto families,

- leave gaps in coverage,

- and allow prices to rise unchecked.

A new healthcare backbone changes that by establishing a simple, universal baseline that works for everyone --- and forces the rest of the system to play fair.

## **A simple comparison**

### **Today's system**

- Private insurers control access

- Prices vary wildly by location and plan

- Coverage depends on job, income, and paperwork

- Rural hospitals survive on financial guesswork

- People bear the risk

### **A backbone system**

- A guaranteed baseline plan exists everywhere

- Clear rules apply to everyone

- Costs are capped and predictable

- Coverage is stable

- Private plans compete on top --- not in control

The backbone does not eliminate private insurance.

It ends their monopoly on system design.

## **What a healthcare backbone actually does**

A backbone sets the rules of the road.

It determines:

- what is covered

- how much people can be charged

- how providers are paid

- how disputes are resolved

- how stability is maintained

Right now, those rules are fragmented and largely written by insurers.

A backbone makes them public, simple, and enforceable.

## **What makes a backbone "people-first"**

A people-first backbone must meet five tests:

### **1. Universal availability**

Every American can enroll --- regardless of job, income, age, or state.

No coverage gaps.

No eligibility cliffs.

No "wrong category" problems.

### **2. Real affordability**

The backbone:

- lowers monthly premiums

- caps deductibles

- limits out-of-pocket costs

- protects against catastrophic bills

Affordability means what people actually pay, not just sticker prices.

### **3. Stability**

Coverage doesn't disappear because:

- your income fluctuated

- your paperwork was delayed

- your job changed

- a state made a policy choice

Healthcare shouldn't depend on administrative luck.

### **4. Rural viability**

The backbone:

- supports rural hospitals

- stabilizes essential services

- reduces uncompensated care

- pays fairly and predictably

A system that only works in cities is not a national system.

### **5. Power balance**

Private insurers can participate --- but:

- they don't design the foundation

- they don't control access

- they don't profit from confusion

The backbone sets the terms.

Everyone else competes within them.

## **What the backbone is** 

## **not**

To be clear, a healthcare backbone is not:

- government takeover of hospitals

- elimination of private insurance

- one-size-fits-all care

- a tax increase

- centralized micromanagement of medicine

It is standard-setting, not control.

## **How this lowers costs without raising taxes**

The backbone lowers costs by removing waste and leverage points that drive prices up.

Specifically, it:

- reduces administrative duplication

- limits pricing power

- stabilizes risk pools

- prevents cost shifting

- creates real competition

- replaces chaos with predictability

When prices fall, subsidies fall.

When waste disappears, spending drops.

This is how affordability improves without new taxes.

## **Why the ACA needs a new backbone**

The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage --- but it left the foundation unchanged.

It relied on:

- private insurers to manage access

- subsidies to offset high prices

- regulation to control behavior

That approach helped --- but it hit a ceiling.

A backbone replaces:

- endless regulation\
  \
  with

- structural clarity

It fixes the engine instead of constantly adjusting the dashboard.

## **The big decision ahead**

There are multiple ways to build a backbone, including:

- a national public option

- a Medicare or Medicaid buy-in

- an expanded Basic Health Program

- hybrid public--private models

Each has strengths and weaknesses.

This project will evaluate them openly and honestly, using one standard:

> Does it lower costs, protect people, keep rural hospitals alive, and shift power away from insurers?

If it doesn't, it doesn't make the cut.

## **Where we go from here**

Now that the foundation is clear, the next phase begins.

We will:

- examine each backbone option

- expose insurer, provider, and drug pricing loopholes

- design affordability caps

- build a rural stabilization package

- and draft a proposal Congress can actually pass

Step by step. In public.
