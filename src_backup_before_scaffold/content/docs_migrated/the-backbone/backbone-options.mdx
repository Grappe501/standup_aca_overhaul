# **Backbone Options: Public Option vs Buy-In vs Hybrid**

(What works, what doesn't, and what can pass)

Paste into:

/the-backbone/backbone-options.html

## **The short version (3 minutes)**

There is more than one way to build a healthcare backbone.

Some options are stronger.

Some are more politically realistic.

Some look good on paper but fail in practice.

This project evaluates each option using one standard:

> Does it lower costs, protect people, keep rural hospitals open, and shift power away from insurers --- without raising taxes?

If it doesn't meet that test, it doesn't belong in a people-first plan.

## **What all backbone options must accomplish**

Before comparing options, it's important to be clear about the job.

A real backbone must:

- be available everywhere

- cap what people pay

- stabilize coverage

- discipline prices

- support rural hospitals

- reduce administrative waste

- limit insurer power

If an option fails on these fundamentals, it is not a backbone --- it's a patch.

## **Option 1: A National Public Option**

### **What it is**

A government-run health plan available to anyone, offered alongside private insurance.

People can choose it.

Employers can offer it.

Insurers must compete with it.

### **Strengths**

- Creates a credible competitor to private insurers

- Sets a pricing benchmark that pressures the market

- Can be designed with simple rules and broad networks

- Strong tool for lowering premiums in concentrated markets

- Gives rural areas a fallback where insurers won't compete

### **Weaknesses**

- Requires careful provider payment design to avoid underpaying

- Faces ideological opposition regardless of structure

- Needs guardrails to prevent private insurers from gaming around it

### **Power shift**

High --- insurers lose monopoly control over plan design.

### **Passability**

Moderate --- difficult, but achievable with phased rollout and rural-first framing.

## **Option 2: Medicare or Medicaid Buy-In**

### **What it is**

Allows people to buy into an existing public program before they qualify by age or income.

### **Strengths**

- Uses existing infrastructure

- Familiar to providers

- Lower administrative overhead

- Strong cost control tools already exist

### **Weaknesses**

- Medicare payment rates can be too low for some providers

- Medicaid stigma and state variation create barriers

- Risk of provider resistance without payment reform

- Not automatically universal unless eligibility is broad

### **Power shift**

Moderate to high, depending on design.

### **Passability**

Moderate --- easier than a brand-new program, but still contested.

## **Option 3: Expanded Basic Health Program (BHP)**

### **What it is**

A little-known ACA option that states can use to offer low-cost public coverage for lower-income residents.

### **Strengths**

- Already authorized in law

- Proven to reduce churn

- Low premiums and cost sharing

- High satisfaction where implemented

### **Weaknesses**

- Limited to lower-income populations

- State-by-state patchwork

- Does not create a universal backbone on its own

- Leaves many people outside the system

### **Power shift**

Low to moderate --- helpful, but incomplete.

### **Passability**

High, but limited impact unless expanded nationally.

## **Option 4: Hybrid Public Backbone + Private Wrap**

### **What it is**

A public baseline plan that:

- covers essential services

- caps costs

- stabilizes payment

Private insurers can offer "wraparound" coverage for extras.

### **Strengths**

- Strong cost and access guarantees

- Preserves choice without ceding control

- Reduces insurer incentive to game the system

- Works well for rural stabilization

- Clear separation of public responsibility and private options

### **Weaknesses**

- Requires careful coordination

- Less familiar to the public

- Will be attacked as "too complex" by those who benefit from chaos

### **Power shift**

Very high --- insurers no longer control the foundation.

### **Passability**

Moderate --- best framed as modernization, not replacement.

## **What does** 

## **not**

##  **work**

Some ideas sound appealing but fail under scrutiny.

### **"Just regulate insurers more"**

- Doesn't address structural power

- Creates endless rule-writing

- Encourages more gaming

### **"Just expand subsidies"**

- Props up high prices

- Increases federal spending without fixing costs

- Leaves families exposed

### **"Let the market handle it"**

- Markets without rules produce monopolies

- Rural areas are abandoned

- Prices rise faster than wages

## **Early conclusion (not final)**

Based on cost, access, rural viability, and power shift:

- Pure BHP expansion is not enough

- Buy-ins help, but need payment reform

- Public options work best when they are real competitors

- Hybrid backbone models offer the strongest long-term stability

This project will likely recommend:

- a hybrid public backbone

- phased in

- with a strong rural first strategy

- and a clear congressional path

But we will prove it before declaring it.

## **What comes next**

Now we shift from options to design.

Next pages will cover:

- how we cap premiums and out-of-pocket costs

- how we pay providers fairly

- how we keep rural hospitals open

- how we close remaining loopholes

- how this passes Congress without raising taxes
