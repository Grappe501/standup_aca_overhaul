# **ACA for the People**

## **Fiscal One-Pager: Where the Savings Come From**

(Lowering costs without raising taxes)

## **The bottom line (30 seconds)**

ACA for the People does not require new taxes.

It lowers total healthcare spending by:

- removing waste,

- stopping rent extraction,

- lowering prices structurally,

- and reducing downstream emergency costs.

Savings come from changing rules, not cutting care.

## **Core fiscal principle**

> When prices fall and waste disappears, subsidies shrink automatically.

The current system:

- subsidizes high prices,

- rewards inefficiency,

- and shifts costs instead of reducing them.

This proposal reverses that dynamic.

## **Savings bucket #1: Insurance loophole closure**

What's happening now

- Insurers profit from delay, denial, churn, and complex plan design

- Administrative spending is misclassified as "medical"

- Cost shifting hides real prices

What changes

- Tightened Medical Loss Ratio rules

- Standardized plan designs

- Limits on prior authorization abuse

- Penalties for profit from delay or denial

Fiscal impact

- Lower administrative overhead

- Fewer unnecessary denials and appeals

- Reduced insurer rent extraction

âž¡ï¸ Result: premiums fall â†’ subsidy costs fall

## **Savings bucket #2: Administrative simplification**

What's happening now

- Multiple eligibility systems

- Duplicative billing and reporting

- Endless paperwork and rework

- High non-clinical labor costs

What changes

- No-wrong-door enrollment

- Standardized billing and claims

- Automated eligibility verification

- Reduced reporting duplication

Fiscal impact

- Lower provider overhead

- Faster claims processing

- Fewer coverage losses due to paperwork

- Reduced emergency care from churn

âž¡ï¸ Result: system spends less without cutting benefits

## **Savings bucket #3: Drug pricing reform (middlemen)**

What's happening now

- Rebates inflate list prices

- PBMs keep savings

- Spread pricing raises costs invisibly

- Patients pay off inflated prices

What changes

- Point-of-sale rebate pass-through

- Spread pricing banned

- Transparent, fee-based PBM compensation

- Faster generic and biosimilar access

Fiscal impact

- Lower out-of-pocket costs

- Lower plan drug spending

- Lower federal subsidy outlays tied to drug costs

âž¡ï¸ Result: savings go to patients, not intermediaries

## **Savings bucket #4: Coverage stability (less churn)**

What's happening now

- People lose coverage over paperwork or small income changes

- Care is delayed

- Conditions worsen

- Emergency care rises

What changes

- Continuous eligibility

- Seamless transitions between programs

- Automatic enrollment where possible

Fiscal impact

- Fewer emergency admissions

- Lower uncompensated care

- Reduced downstream high-cost treatment

âž¡ï¸ Result: earlier care costs less than crisis care

## **Savings bucket #5: Price discipline through a public backbone**

What's happening now

- Insurers negotiate in concentrated markets

- Prices drift upward

- Subsidies chase prices

What changes

- A public baseline sets a pricing benchmark

- Private plans must compete honestly

- Excessive prices lose market share

Fiscal impact

- Downward pressure on premiums

- Reduced need for subsidy growth

- More predictable long-term spending

âž¡ï¸ Result: cost control without price fixing

## **What we are** 

## **not**

##  **doing fiscally**

- âŒ No new taxes

- âŒ No payroll assessments

- âŒ No individual mandates

- âŒ No benefit cuts

- âŒ No provider underpayment shock

Savings come from structural efficiency, not austerity.

## **Budget neutrality and beyond**

- Near-term: reform is budget-neutral through savings capture

- Medium-term: subsidy growth slows as prices fall

- Long-term: system costs stabilize instead of compounding

This is fiscal discipline through design, not denial.

## **Why this is credible**

- Savings are distributed across multiple buckets

- No single "magic" offset

- Each bucket targets a known cost driver

- Redundancy prevents failure if one area underperforms

This is how durable policy is financed.

## **One-sentence summary for budget staff**

> ACA for the People lowers federal spending by lowering prices and waste first --- so subsidies naturally shrink without raising taxes.

### **Package status**

You now have:

- a full legislative framework (Titles III--IX)

- constituent explainers

- a congressional staff brief

- coalition defenses

- and a fiscal justification

This is a complete governing package.
