## **Title III --- Establishment of the National Healthcare Backbone**

(This would sit inside a larger bill. Numbering is illustrative.)

## **SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.**

This title may be cited as the "National Healthcare Backbone Act."

## **SEC. 302. PURPOSE.**

The purpose of this title is to establish a national healthcare backbone that:

2.  caps financial exposure for individuals and families;

3.  stabilizes healthcare access in rural and underserved areas;

4.  reduces administrative waste and systemic inefficiency;

5.  rebalances market power away from insurance companies and toward patients and providers; and

6.  achieves these objectives without increasing federal taxes.

## **SEC. 303. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HEALTHCARE BACKBONE PLAN.**

### **(a) Establishment**

The Secretary of Health and Human Services ("the Secretary") shall establish and administer a national baseline health coverage plan, hereafter referred to as the Healthcare Backbone Plan.

2.  offered on all Health Insurance Marketplaces;

3.  available to individuals, families, and employers; and

4.  open to any individual lawfully present in the United States.

2.  adjust automatically based on income changes;

3.  eliminate coverage cliffs caused by minor income fluctuations.

### **(b) Out-of-Pocket Maximum**

The Secretary shall establish a true annual out-of-pocket maximum that:

1.  includes deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance;

### **(c) Point-of-Care Protections**

The Secretary shall ensure low or zero cost-sharing for:

## **SEC. 306. RELATIONSHIP TO PRIVATE INSURANCE.**

### **(a) Competition and Wraparound Coverage**

Private insurers may:

1.  offer plans that compete directly with the Healthcare Backbone Plan under standardized rules; or

2.  offer wraparound coverage that supplements the Healthcare Backbone Plan.

Private insurers offering coverage in connection with the Healthcare Backbone Plan may not:

1.  design benefits to circumvent affordability caps;

2.  impose discriminatory network restrictions;

- hospitals,

- physicians,

- clinics,

- rural and critical access providers.

### **(b) Payment Framework**

### **(c) Rural Stabilization**

Special consideration shall be given to:

- rural hospitals,

- maternity services,

- emergency care providers,\
  \
  to ensure stable access regardless of patient volume.

## **SEC. 308. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION.**

### **(a) Simplified Enrollment**

The Secretary shall establish streamlined enrollment procedures, including:

- facilitated enrollment using existing data sources;

- no-wrong-door enrollment mechanisms;

- continuous eligibility protections.

### **(b) Reduced Administrative Burden**

The Secretary shall minimize:

- duplicative billing requirements;

- unnecessary prior authorization;

- redundant reporting obligations.

## **SEC. 309. IMPLEMENTATION AND PHASED ROLLOUT.**

### **(a) Initial Implementation**

## **SEC. 310. FUNDING AND FISCAL INTEGRITY.**

### **(a) Funding Sources**

This title shall be funded through:

1.  reductions in administrative waste;

2.  price discipline and cost savings;

### **(b) No New Taxes**

Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize:

- new federal taxes,

- penalties for non-compliance;

- restitution for affected consumers;

- corrective action requirements.

## **SEC. 312. SEVERABILITY.**

If any provision of this title is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.

## **Why this matters**

This section:

- creates the backbone in law

- avoids micromanagement

- delegates implementation intelligently

- protects affordability

- stabilizes providers

- and is defensible under budget and constitutional scrutiny

This is the center of gravity for the entire proposal.
