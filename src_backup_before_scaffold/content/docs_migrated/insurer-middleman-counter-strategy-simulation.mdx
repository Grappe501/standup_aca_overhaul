# **Insurer & Middleman Counter-Strategy Simulation**

## **Years 1--5 (How the system fights back --- and how it still loses)**

## **YEAR 1 --- Shock & Containment Phase**

("Let's see how hard they're serious")

### **Strategy 1: Paper compliance, real friction**

What they try

- Technically comply with affordability caps

- Increase non-price friction:

  - longer call center wait times

  - slow appeals

  - opaque digital portals

  - "soft" prior auth delays

Why

- Low legal risk

- Hard for regulators to quantify

- Frustration still reduces utilization

Harm

- Patients delay care

- Doctors waste time

- Savings accrue quietly to insurers

Defense already in the plan

- Title V: delay-as-profit prohibited

- Title IX: complaint systems + public reporting

- Transparency on denial and delay rates

Upgrade recommended

- Add time-based enforcement triggers:\
  \
  If median approval times exceed statutory benchmarks â†’ automatic penalties

- Require public monthly metrics, not annual

### **Strategy 2: Reprice benefits to the edges**

What they try

- Keep premiums compliant

- Push costs into:

  - specialty drugs

  - out-of-network edges

  - "non-core" services

- Aggressive tiering within allowed structures

Why

- Affordability caps don't help if access is constrained

- Can discourage high-need enrollees

Harm

- De facto risk selection

- Chronic patients feel it first

Defense already present

- Standardized plan designs

- True out-of-pocket caps

- Network adequacy rules based on real access

Upgrade recommended

- Explicit statutory ban on service-class dumping

- Require parity across chronic, behavioral, and specialty care

## **YEAR 2 --- Market Adaptation Phase**

("Let's route around the backbone")

### **Strategy 3: Network games (the classic move)**

What they try

- Narrow networks that technically meet standards

- Include providers who:

  - aren't accepting patients

  - are geographically distant

  - have long wait times

Why

- Proven tactic

- Cheap way to lower utilization

Harm

- Care delays

- Especially devastating in rural areas

Defense already present

- Network adequacy based on appointment availability

- Provider inclusion requirements

- Enforcement authority

Upgrade recommended

- Add secret shopper authority to HHS

- Require provider attestation of availability

- Auto-decouple cost-sharing if network access fails

### **Strategy 4: Formulary manipulation (PBM-heavy)**

What they try

- Push patients to higher-cost drugs with better rebate economics

- Delay generics through "preferred" placement

- Increase step therapy complexity

Why

- Spread pricing is gone --- but influence remains

- Formularies are powerful and opaque

Harm

- Patients pay more

- Doctors fight appeals

- Public blames "drug prices" instead of plan design

Defense already present

- Rebate pass-through

- Transparency requirements

- Anti-competitive conduct bans

Upgrade recommended

- Require formulary cost-effectiveness justification

- Automatic review if patient cost increases \> X% year-over-year

## **YEAR 3 --- Regulatory Arbitrage Phase**

("Can we move profits somewhere else?")

### **Strategy 5: Shift profit to affiliates**

What they try

- Move margin into:

  - administrative services organizations

  - analytics vendors

  - care management subsidiaries

- Keep insurer MLR compliant on paper

Why

- Preserves profit

- Avoids direct penalties

Harm

- Hidden rent extraction

- Undermines savings assumptions

Defense already present

- Tightened MLR definitions

- Auditing authority

Upgrade recommended

- Related-entity transparency rules

- Consolidated reporting for vertically integrated firms

- Presumption of affiliation unless disproven

### **Strategy 6: Lobby for "technical corrections"**

What they try

- Argue early problems justify:

  - carve-outs

  - exemptions

  - "temporary flexibility"

- Aim to hollow out enforcement quietly

Why

- This is how reform usually dies

- Happens in low-visibility settings

Harm

- Slow erosion

- Allies lose message discipline

Defense already present

- Oversight Commission

- Mandatory reporting

- Public dashboards

Upgrade recommended

- Sunset clauses on any exemptions

- Require Congressional notice for enforcement rollbacks

## **YEAR 4 --- Political Counterattack Phase**

("Let's make it unpopular")

### **Strategy 7: Blame price drops on access issues**

What they try

- Claim:

  - wait times increased

  - providers are leaving

  - "government interference" caused problems

Why

- Narrative attack

- Aimed at moderates

Reality

- Data usually doesn't support this --- but fear spreads faster

Defense

- Early wins already visible

- Drug prices down

- Rural hospitals stabilized

- Access metrics published

Upgrade recommended

- Preemptive access scorecards

- Highlight regions where care improved fastest

### **Strategy 8: Weaponize provider dissatisfaction**

What they try

- Find stressed providers

- Amplify isolated complaints

- Frame payment reform as "underpayment"

Why

- Providers are trusted messengers

Defense

- Predictable payment

- Lower admin burden

- Reduced uncompensated care

Upgrade recommended

- Provider advisory councils

- Rapid-response correction process

- Publish net income stability metrics for rural hospitals

## **YEAR 5 --- Normalization or Collapse Point**

(This is the fork in the road)

### **If enforcement is strong:**

- Insurers adapt

- Profits normalize

- System stabilizes

- Reform becomes politically untouchable

### **If enforcement weakens:**

- Games reappear

- Complexity creeps back

- Costs slowly rise

- Trust erodes

This is the single truth:

> ACA for the People succeeds or fails on enforcement culture, not policy design.

# **Summary: Can the system be gamed?**

Yes --- attempted constantly.

But with:

- standardized designs

- real-time transparency

- automatic penalties

- affiliate disclosure

- strong oversight

...the games become:

- visible

- punishable

- and unprofitable

That's the win condition.

## **Final hard conclusion**

This plan is not naive about corporate behavior.

It assumes:

- maximum adversarial creativity

- slow erosion attempts

- political pressure

- legal challenges

And it still holds --- if Congress and agencies commit to enforcement.
