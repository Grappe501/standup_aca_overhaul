# **Paying for Care: How We Fund Providers Fairly and Keep Rural Hospitals Open**

(Access without overpricing, stability without waste)

Paste into:

/rural/stabilization-plan.html

## **The short version (3 minutes)**

Healthcare reform fails when providers can't survive.

Lower costs mean nothing if:

- hospitals close,

- doctors leave,

- maternity wards disappear,

- or emergency care becomes unreachable.

A people-first system must:

- pay providers fairly,

- reward access --- not just volume,

- reduce administrative burden,

- and keep rural hospitals stable.

This page explains how we do that.

## **The central problem with provider payment today**

Most providers are paid based on:

- how many services they deliver,

- how they code them,

- and how well they navigate billing systems.

This creates three major problems:

1.  Access is punished\
    \
    Being available 24/7 is expensive --- and often unpaid.

2.  Volume is rewarded over value\
    \
    High-margin procedures are favored over essential care.

3.  Small and rural providers lose\
    \
    They lack negotiating power and administrative scale.

A payment system built for large urban hospitals cannot sustain rural care.

## **What "paying fairly" actually means**

Fair payment does not mean paying everyone the same.

It means:

- predictable revenue

- payments tied to community need

- compensation for readiness, not just usage

- reduced overhead and billing waste

A backbone makes this possible by standardizing rules and stabilizing coverage.

## **The payment framework: three pillars**

A people-first backbone uses three complementary payment methods, not one.

### **Pillar 1: Global or access-based payments for rural hospitals**

Rural hospitals provide:

- emergency care

- inpatient stabilization

- maternity services

- chronic disease management

- community health access

They must be ready even when beds are empty.

Access-based payments:

- provide a predictable annual budget

- are tied to service availability

- reduce reliance on volume

- protect essential departments

Hospitals are paid to be there --- not just to bill.

### **Pillar 2: Simplified fee schedules for routine care**

For clinics, physicians, and outpatient services:

- payment is standardized

- billing is simplified

- coding games are reduced

- administrative overhead drops

This benefits:

- independent providers

- community clinics

- rural practices

- safety-net systems

Less paperwork means more care.

### **Pillar 3: Incentives for continuity and outcomes**

Instead of rewarding churn and fragmentation, the system:

- encourages long-term patient relationships

- supports chronic care management

- rewards preventive care

- discourages avoidable hospitalizations

Providers are paid for keeping people healthy --- not for cycling them through crises.

## **How this stabilizes rural hospitals specifically**

A backbone-supported payment model:

- reduces uncompensated care

- smooths revenue volatility

- lowers billing complexity

- strengthens workforce retention

- limits pressure to consolidate

This allows hospitals to:

- plan

- invest

- and remain locally accountable

Rural care stops being an emergency patchwork.

## **What this means for healthcare workers**

Healthcare workers are leaving because:

- paperwork overwhelms care

- staffing is unstable

- burnout is constant

- financial pressure never eases

Simplified payment and stable funding:

- reduce administrative burden

- improve staffing predictability

- allow clinicians to practice medicine

- restore morale

A system that works for workers works for patients.

## **Why this doesn't drive prices back up**

A fair concern is:

> If we pay providers more fairly, won't costs rise again?

Not under a backbone.

Because:

- prices are standardized

- insurer leverage is reduced

- administrative waste is cut

- cost-shifting disappears

- competition becomes real

We replace chaos with structure --- not blank checks.

## **Why the ACA couldn't do this alone**

The ACA:

- expanded coverage

- regulated insurance behavior

- increased access

But it:

- left payment fragmentation intact

- relied on insurers as intermediaries

- lacked tools to stabilize access-based care

A backbone provides those tools.

## **The takeaway**

Providers don't need:

- more paperwork

- more billing codes

- more short-term bailouts

They need:

- stability

- fairness

- simplicity

- and a system designed around access

A people-first healthcare system must keep care close to home.

## **What comes next**

We've now built:

- the diagnosis

- the power shift

- the backbone

- affordability protection

- and provider stability

Next, we turn to how this actually passes Congress --- without raising taxes.
