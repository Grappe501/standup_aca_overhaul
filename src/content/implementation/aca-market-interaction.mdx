## The short version (2–3 minutes)

The Backbone does not replace the Affordable Care Act.

It completes it.

The ACA fixed unfair rules and expanded access. The Backbone provides the stable foundation the ACA was never designed to supply.

Together, they create a system that is fair **and** durable.

---

## What the ACA already does well

The ACA established essential protections:

- coverage regardless of health status,
- essential health benefits,
- Medicaid expansion in many states,
- income-based subsidies,
- consumer protections against abuse.

These gains remain intact.

The Backbone builds underneath them.

## Why ACA markets remain unstable

ACA marketplaces struggle because they sit on top of an unstable foundation.

They face:

- coverage churn,
- rising premiums,
- complex plan design,
- heavy administrative overhead,
- constant subsidy adjustments.

Markets are asked to compensate for structural instability they cannot fix.

---

## How the Backbone stabilizes ACA markets

With a public baseline in place:

- essential care is no longer plan-dependent,
- pricing has a clear anchor,
- administrative complexity decreases,
- risk is pooled more broadly.

ACA plans become **supplemental** rather than foundational.

This reduces pressure on premiums and improves plan predictability.

---

## What happens to subsidies

Subsidies do not disappear overnight.

But as baseline costs stabilize:

- premiums fall naturally,
- subsidy growth slows,
- public spending becomes more predictable,
- fewer emergency adjustments are required.

Subsidies support choice — not rescue dysfunction.

---

## What happens to plan choice

Consumers retain choice.

ACA plans:

- continue to offer supplemental benefits,
- compete on service and value,
- simplify designs,
- stop relying on exclusion to manage costs.

Choice becomes meaningful rather than overwhelming.

---

## What happens to insurers

Insurers remain part of the system.

But their role changes:

- from gatekeepers to competitors,
- from risk managers to service providers,
- from complexity creators to efficiency seekers.

Honest competition becomes possible.

---

## Why this avoids market disruption

Because the Backbone absorbs baseline risk:

- insurers face less volatility,
- provider networks stabilize,
- markets stop swinging year to year.

The transition strengthens markets instead of shocking them.

---

## The core insight

The ACA made coverage possible.

The Backbone makes coverage stable.

One without the other leaves the system incomplete.

## What comes next

Markets only function when responsibilities are clear.

Next, we look at how federal and state roles are defined under the Backbone — and why clarity matters for accountability and trust.
