## The short version (2–3 minutes)

Healthcare works best when responsibility is clear.

Under the Backbone:

- the federal government sets the foundation,
- states administer and adapt within clear rules,
- accountability is shared — but not blurred.

This structure preserves flexibility without sacrificing stability.

---

## Why shared responsibility matters

Purely federal systems can feel distant.

Purely state-based systems fracture.

The Backbone combines both:

- national guarantees everyone can rely on,
- state-level administration that reflects local needs.

Uniform access does not require uniform management.

---

## What the federal government does

The federal role is to **define and protect the foundation**.

It:

- establishes universal baseline coverage,
- sets essential benefit standards,
- anchors payment rules,
- enforces continuity and access guarantees,
- provides funding stability.

These elements must be national to prevent fragmentation and inequality.

---

## What states do

States are responsible for **administration and delivery coordination**.

They:

- manage enrollment and outreach,
- coordinate provider participation,
- oversee payment operations,
- integrate with existing programs,
- tailor implementation within federal standards.

States remain the operational stewards of care.

---

## How this builds on existing systems

The Backbone does not require states to start from zero.

It builds on:

- Medicaid infrastructure,
- existing exchange systems,
- provider networks,
- state health agencies.

States that have invested in administration are rewarded — not penalized.

---

## Guardrails against fragmentation

Federal standards prevent:

- benefit erosion,
- access disparities,
- race-to-the-bottom policies,
- coverage gaps across state lines.

States cannot opt out of the baseline — but they can improve on it.

---

## Accountability and transparency

Clear roles mean clear accountability.

Under the Backbone:

- the federal government is accountable for coverage guarantees,
- states are accountable for administration and access,
- providers are accountable for care delivery,
- insurers are accountable for supplemental value.

Responsibility is visible — not hidden in complexity.

---

## Funding flow and stability

Funding follows responsibility.

The federal government:

- ensures predictable baseline funding,
- absorbs systemic risk,
- reduces state budget volatility.

States focus on execution, not fiscal triage.

---

## Why this matters for trust

People trust systems when they know:

- who is responsible,
- where to turn when something fails,
- what protections exist regardless of location.

Clarity builds confidence.

---

## The core insight

Durable systems separate **standards** from **operations**.

The Backbone does that cleanly — guaranteeing access nationally while allowing care to work locally.

---

## What comes next

Every system needs safeguards.

Next, we look at how risks are managed, how failures are contained, and how the Backbone prevents new forms of instability.
