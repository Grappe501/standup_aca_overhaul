## **PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT**

This outline shows:

Legislative counsel can use this as:

- a drafting map,
- a checklist,
- or a modular menu.

The backbone (Title II) is the structural keystone but can be phased.

## **DRAFTING WARNINGS FOR COUNSEL**

⚠️ Avoid:

- broad “Secretary determines” language on major policy
- retroactive penalties
- coercive funding threats to states
✅ Prefer:

- formulas
- deadlines
- defaults
- clear prohibitions
- severability everywhere
## **WHAT THIS GIVES LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL**

- A clean map of insert vs. amend
- Clear jurisdictional lanes
- Litigation-aware drafting guidance
- Modular legislative flexibility
- Reduced redrafting cycles
This is how you get from idea → statute without losing the substance.

_Source: SAMPLE STATUTORY LANGUAGE.docx_

## **ACA for the People (Model Draft)**

## **SECTION 301. STATUTORY AFFORDABILITY CAPS AND COST PROTECTIONS.**

### **(a) IN GENERAL.**

Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

“(k) STATUTORY AFFORDABILITY CAPS.

(1) MAXIMUM PREMIUM CONTRIBUTION.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annual premium contribution required of an applicable taxpayer for coverage under a qualified health plan or Healthcare Backbone Plan shall not exceed the applicable percentage of household income set forth in paragraph (2).

(2) APPLICABLE PERCENTAGES.

For purposes of paragraph (1), the applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:

| Household Income (% FPL) | Maximum Premium Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| ≤ 150% | 0.0 percent |
| >150%–200% | 2.0 percent |
| >200%–300% | 4.0 percent |
| >300%–400% | 6.0 percent |
| >400% | 8.5 percent |

(3) PROHIBITION ON COST SHIFTING.

No issuer may impose deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing mechanisms that, individually or in aggregate, have the effect of circumventing the premium contribution limits established under this subsection.

(4) TRUE OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM.

For purposes of this Act, the term ‘out-of-pocket maximum’ shall include all cost-sharing expenditures for covered services, including prescription drugs, out-of-network emergency services, and ancillary services. No exclusions shall apply unless expressly authorized by statute.

(5) NONDISCRETIONARY ENFORCEMENT.

Compliance with this subsection shall be mandatory. The Secretary shall not waive, suspend, or modify the requirements of this subsection through regulation, guidance, or enforcement discretion.

(6) JUDICIAL REVIEW.

Failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.”

### **(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.**

Section 1302(c) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. §18022(c)) is amended to conform cost-sharing limitations to subsection (k) of section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code.

### **🔎 Why this section is strong**

- Affordability is numerical, not discretionary
- Caps are enforceable without agency enthusiasm
- Courts can read and apply it directly
- Insurers cannot game around it with cost-shifting
- This survives a hostile administration and a hostile court
## **SECTION 701. PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATE PASS-THROUGH AND SPREAD PRICING PROHIBITION.**

### **(a) REBATE PASS-THROUGH REQUIREMENT.**

Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. §300gg et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

“SEC. 2799D–1. PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATE TRANSPARENCY AND PASS-THROUGH.

(a) IN GENERAL.

Any rebate, discount, price concession, or other remuneration received by a health plan, pharmacy benefit manager, or any affiliate thereof, in connection with a covered prescription drug, shall be applied directly to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the covered individual at the point of sale.

(b) PROHIBITION ON RETENTION.

No entity described in subsection (a) may retain, aggregate, or reallocate such remuneration for any purpose other than reducing the cost of the drug to the covered individual.

(c) NO OFFSET OR DELAY.

The application of remuneration under this section shall not be deferred, averaged, or offset through premium adjustments or other mechanisms.

(d) ENFORCEMENT.

A violation of this section shall be treated as a prohibited transaction subject to civil monetary penalties not to exceed $100,000 per violation, adjusted annually for inflation.

(e) NONPREEMPTION OF STRONGER FEDERAL PROTECTIONS.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to impose stricter transparency or consumer protection requirements under Federal law.”

### **(b) SPREAD PRICING BAN.**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after section 725 the following:

“SEC. 725A. PROHIBITION ON SPREAD PRICING.

(a) IN GENERAL.

A pharmacy benefit manager shall not charge a health plan sponsor a price for a prescription drug that exceeds the amount paid to the dispensing pharmacy for such drug, except for a bona fide administrative fee disclosed in advance.

(b) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.

Any administrative fee permitted under subsection (a) shall be:

(1) flat and not percentage-based;

(2) disclosed in writing; and

(3) unrelated to the price of the drug.

(c) PROHIBITED PRACTICE.

Any differential between amounts charged and amounts paid, other than permitted fees, shall constitute unlawful spread pricing.

(d) PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT.

A plan sponsor, pharmacy, or covered individual adversely affected by a violation of this section may bring an action for injunctive relief.”

### **🔎 Why this section is strong**

- No rate-setting (avoids takings claims)
- No agency creativity required
- ERISA-safe federal authority
- Mechanical compliance = easy auditing
- Patients feel savings immediately
## **What we’ve now done (this is important)**

You now have:

- real statutory text
- that could be dropped into a draft bill
- with minimal reinterpretation
- and maximum durability
This is no longer “policy language.”

This is law-shaped.
