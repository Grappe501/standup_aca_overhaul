## Why Healthcare Costs So Much  
*(And why it isn’t because Americans use “too much care”)*

---

## WHY: Why high healthcare costs matter

### The short version (2–3 minutes)

Healthcare in the United States is expensive **by design**, not by accident.

Americans are not dramatically sicker or more reckless than people in other developed countries. We do not use significantly more care. Yet we pay far more — in premiums, deductibles, surprise bills, and lost wages — and still feel financially exposed.

That mismatch between **what people pay** and **what they receive** is the problem.

High healthcare costs don’t just affect budgets. They affect behavior:

- People delay care because prices are unpredictable  
- Families carry medical debt even when insured  
- Employers shift costs to workers or drop coverage  
- Rural hospitals struggle to stay open  
- Doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork than patients  

This is not a failure of individual responsibility.

It is a failure of system design.

### A simple truth most debates avoid

Healthcare cost debates often focus on ideology:

- government vs. private  
- socialism vs. capitalism  
- personal responsibility  

Those arguments miss the central issue.

Costs rise because the **rules allow certain players to charge more without delivering more**, and because complexity shields those rules from accountability.

To understand healthcare costs, you have to follow incentives — and follow the money.

## HOW: How the system pushes costs upward

### Where your healthcare dollar actually goes

When you pay a premium, copay, or medical bill, that money is divided roughly into five areas:

1. **Care delivery**  
   Doctors, nurses, hospitals, clinics, equipment.

2. **Insurance administration**  
   Claims processing, marketing, profit, executive compensation.

3. **Provider pricing power**  
   High hospital and specialist prices, especially where competition is limited.

4. **Drug pricing and middlemen**  
   Manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), rebates, and spread pricing.

5. **Administrative waste**  
   Billing complexity, paperwork, denials, eligibility churn.

In a well-functioning system, most dollars go to care.

In the U.S. system, too much money flows to administration, pricing strategies, and intermediaries — without improving outcomes.

### The myth: “Healthcare is expensive because people overuse it”

Unnecessary care exists. But it is not the main driver of cost.

What actually drives spending is:

- **prices, not volume**  
- **consolidation, not demand**  
- **incentives, not patient behavior**  

Americans do not visit doctors far more often than people in other developed countries.

They are simply charged more each time they do.

---

### Insurance complexity as a business strategy

Insurance companies are private businesses. Their job is to manage financial risk.

Under current rules, that often means:

- designing plans that look affordable but shift costs later  
- delaying or denying care through prior authorization  
- narrowing provider networks quietly  
- exploiting confusing enrollment and eligibility rules  
- benefiting from constant plan switching (“churn”)  

Complexity is not an accident.

It protects margins by making prices, coverage, and responsibility harder to understand — and harder to challenge.

### Why hospitals overcharge — especially in rural areas

Hospitals are not immune from responsibility, but many are reacting to pressure rather than creating it.

They face:

- low public reimbursement rates  
- high administrative burden  
- delayed or denied insurer payments  
- shrinking patient bases  
- rising labor and supply costs  

To survive, hospitals often:

- charge higher prices to privately insured patients  
- add facility fees  
- merge with larger systems  
- cut essential but unprofitable services, like maternity care  

Rural hospitals feel this first.

When a rural hospital closes, it means:

- longer emergency response times  
- delayed diagnoses  
- families driving hours for care  
- loss of one of the largest local employers  

A system that only works in dense, wealthy areas is not a national system.

---

### Drug pricing and middlemen: cost without value

Prescription drug prices are not driven only by innovation.

They are inflated by:

- opaque rebate arrangements  
- middlemen taking spreads  
- formularies designed around profit rather than outcomes  
- weak price competition  
- prices disconnected from production cost  

Much of this money never improves care.

It circulates inside the system.

---

### Administrative waste: the hidden cost everyone pays

The U.S. healthcare system relies heavily on paperwork:

- multiple billing codes for the same service  
- repeated eligibility checks  
- prior authorization back-and-forth  
- appeals designed to exhaust providers and patients  
- coverage losses due to technical errors  

This waste:

- raises costs  
- delays treatment  
- burns out workers  
- pushes people out of coverage  

It functions like a hidden tax — paid to inefficiency, not government.

## WHAT: What the ACA fixed — and what it didn’t

### What the Affordable Care Act improved

The Affordable Care Act made meaningful changes:

- expanded coverage  
- ended denial for preexisting conditions  
- set basic consumer protections  
- reduced the uninsured rate  

Those improvements matter and should be preserved.

---

### What the ACA did not change

The ACA did not redesign the system underneath.

It left:

- insurers in charge of plan design  
- prices largely unchecked  
- hospitals dependent on cost-shifting  
- rural systems vulnerable  
- administrative complexity intact  

The ACA helped people **enter** the system.

It did not change how the system **extracts money once they are inside it**.

---

## The takeaway

Healthcare costs are high because:

- incentives reward complexity  
- pricing power faces little restraint  
- risk is shifted onto families  
- there is no strong public backbone enforcing fair rules  

Lowering costs requires more than subsidies or slogans.

It requires changing **how the system is designed to operate**.

Next sections explain:

- how insurance power works in practice  
- why rural hospitals are the system’s early warning signal  
- what a healthcare backbone would change  
- how costs can come down without raising taxes  
- what Congress could realistically pass
