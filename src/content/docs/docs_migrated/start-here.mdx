## What This Project Is — and Why It Matters

### The short version (2–3 minutes)

Healthcare in America costs more than anywhere else in the world — and delivers less security in return.

Families pay high monthly premiums, face unpredictable bills even when insured, and remain one serious illness away from financial harm. Employers struggle to offer coverage. Rural hospitals are closing. Doctors and nurses spend more time fighting paperwork than caring for patients.

The Affordable Care Act helped millions gain coverage. That matters.

But it did not fix the system underneath.

Costs kept rising. Insurance companies retained control over pricing and access. Patients remained exposed to financial risk. Rural communities were left behind.

This project exists to fix that.

We are building a **people-first overhaul of the Affordable Care Act** that:

- lowers monthly premiums  
- caps how much families can ever be forced to pay  
- guarantees coverage for everyone  
- keeps rural hospitals open  
- shifts power away from insurance companies  
- does **not** raise taxes  
- and can realistically pass Congress  

This is not a slogan.

This is a real policy blueprint, built in public, step by step.

## What we have now — and why it feels broken

Most Americans don’t experience healthcare as a policy debate.

They experience it as a series of shocks:

- A premium that rises every year, even when wages don’t  
- A deductible so high insurance feels unusable  
- A denial letter that contradicts their doctor  
- A hospital bill they did not expect and cannot plan for  
- A local hospital closing, forcing longer drives in emergencies  

People ask reasonable questions:

- Why am I paying so much and still afraid to use my insurance?  
- Why does coverage disappear when my income changes slightly?  
- Why does my doctor say yes while my insurer says no?  
- Why does “being insured” still feel financially dangerous?  

These aren’t misunderstandings.

They are symptoms of how the system is designed.

## What the Affordable Care Act fixed — and what it didn’t

### What the ACA fixed

Before the Affordable Care Act:

- People with preexisting conditions were locked out  
- Coverage disappeared when people got sick  
- Young adults lost insurance overnight  
- Millions had no access at any price  

The ACA changed that.

It expanded coverage, ended health-based discrimination, and stabilized insurance markets that were failing. Those gains are real — and they should not be reversed.

### What the ACA did *not* fix

The ACA expanded access, but **left the underlying power structure intact**.

It did not:

- Control how much insurers charge  
- Cap how much families are exposed to when they get sick  
- Stop premiums from rising faster than wages  
- Prevent unusable plans built around high deductibles  
- Protect rural hospitals from collapse  
- Change who ultimately decides whether care happens  

The ACA helped people **enter** the system.

It did not change how the system **treats them once they’re in it**.

That is why so many Americans are insured — and still afraid to use their insurance.

## Why rural communities feel the failure first — and hardest

If you want to understand what is broken in American healthcare, look at rural America.

Rural communities are not a special case.  
They are the **stress test** the system fails.

In rural areas:

- There are fewer hospitals  
- There is less competition  
- People are older, sicker, and poorer on average  
- Distances are longer and options are fewer  

When costs rise, rural hospitals absorb the hit first.  
When insurers narrow networks, rural providers are dropped first.  
When reimbursements fall, rural facilities close first.

And when a rural hospital closes, it is not an inconvenience.

It means:

- longer emergency response times  
- delayed diagnoses  
- pregnant women driving hours for delivery  
- communities losing their largest employer  
- entire counties becoming medical deserts  

The ACA did not cause rural hospital closures —  
but it did not stop them either.

A system that only works in wealthy metro areas is not a national healthcare system.

Any solution that does not stabilize rural hospitals is not a solution at all.

## This is a design failure — not a funding failure

America already spends more per person on healthcare than any other country.

Yet families pay more, get less certainty, and shoulder more risk.

That tells us something important:

This is not primarily a funding problem.  
It is a **design problem**.

Money flows efficiently to:

- insurance profits  
- administrative overhead  
- billing complexity  
- pricing opacity  

It does **not** reliably flow to:

- patient care  
- rural stability  
- predictable family costs  

The ACA added coverage on top of this design.  
It did not redesign it.

That is the gap this project exists to close.

## What this project is building

We are designing a **new healthcare backbone** — a guaranteed baseline plan that:

- is available to every American  
- sets clear, enforceable rules  
- caps what people pay  
- stabilizes rural hospitals  
- forces private plans to compete honestly  
- simplifies enrollment and coverage  
- eliminates waste that drives costs up  

Think of it like this:

Roads, water, and electricity have public standards because society depends on them.

Healthcare should too.

Private options can exist — but the foundation must serve the public.

## Our non-negotiable principles

1. **Affordability first**  
   Lower premiums *and* lower out-of-pocket costs.

2. **Universal and fair**  
   No income cliffs. No state-based dead ends.

3. **Cap what families pay**  
   No financial ruin for getting sick.

4. **No new taxes**  
   Reform is paid for by removing waste and rent extraction.

5. **Rural hospitals survive**  
   If it doesn’t work outside cities, it fails.

6. **Power must move**  
   Lower costs without shifting control is not enough.

7. **It must be passable**  
   We build what’s best — and what Congress can pass.

## How this site works

Each section answers four questions:

1. What is the problem?  
2. Who benefits from the current setup?  
3. How does it hurt people?  
4. What would we change?

No jargon. No hidden assumptions. No closed-door policymaking.
