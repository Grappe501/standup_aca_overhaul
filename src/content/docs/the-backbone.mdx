## The short version (2–3 minutes)

The problem with U.S. healthcare is not a lack of rules.

It is a lack of structure.

For decades, we have tried to regulate a system built on complexity, instability, and private control of the foundation. That approach has limits — and we have reached them.

The Backbone is a new foundation underneath the existing system.

It does not eliminate private insurance.

It **removes their control over the core**.

---

## What a backbone is — and why it matters

Every durable system has a backbone.

In healthcare, a backbone is the part of the system that:

- guarantees access,
- stabilizes costs,
- simplifies administration,
- and absorbs risk that markets cannot manage.

Right now, the United States does not have one.

Instead, private insurance plans sit at the center — controlling access, pricing, and complexity.

The Backbone replaces that fragile foundation with something simple and universal.

---

## What the Backbone does

At its core, the Backbone provides **baseline healthcare coverage** for everyone.

It:

- guarantees access to essential care,
- establishes predictable payment rules,
- creates a stable pricing floor,
- reduces administrative overhead,
- and ensures continuity of coverage.

Above the Backbone, private insurance can still operate.

But it must compete honestly — on service, efficiency, and value — not on exclusion or complexity.

---

## What the Backbone does *not* do

The Backbone does **not**:

- abolish private insurance,
- centralize all healthcare delivery,
- dictate medical decisions,
- replace doctors or hospitals,
- require people to give up choice.

It simply removes private control over the foundation.

---

## How the Backbone changes incentives

### From risk avoidance to health stability

Today, insurers are rewarded for avoiding risk.

Under the Backbone:

- basic risk is pooled publicly,
- long-term health outcomes matter,
- churn loses its value,
- stability becomes the goal.

---

### From complexity to simplicity

The Backbone replaces dozens of overlapping rules with a clear baseline.

That means:

- fewer billing systems,
- less prior authorization,
- simpler reimbursement,
- lower administrative costs.

Providers spend less time navigating rules and more time delivering care.

---

### From cost shifting to cost control

Right now, costs are shifted — not controlled.

The Backbone:

- anchors prices to a public baseline,
- limits runaway price growth,
- reduces the need for constant subsidies,
- stabilizes provider revenue.

Cost control becomes structural, not reactive.

---

## Why this stabilizes rural healthcare

Rural systems fail when payments are unpredictable and overhead is high.

The Backbone fixes both.

It provides:

- guaranteed baseline reimbursement,
- simplified billing,
- stable coverage regardless of employment,
- protection against churn.

Rural care stops being an exception case.

It becomes part of the system by design.

---

## Why this lowers costs without cutting care

Lower costs do not come from denying care.

They come from removing waste.

The Backbone reduces costs by:

- eliminating redundant administration,
- simplifying pricing,
- reducing delays and denials,
- stabilizing care over time.

Care improves because the system stops fighting itself.

---

## Why regulation alone cannot replace a backbone

Rules can limit abuse.

They cannot create stability where none exists.

As long as private insurers control:

- plan design,
- access rules,
- reimbursement mechanics,
- and administrative complexity,

regulation will always chase behavior — not shape it.

The Backbone changes the structure those rules operate within.

---

## How this builds on the ACA — not against it

The Affordable Care Act made healthcare fairer.

The Backbone makes it durable.

It:

- preserves protections for preexisting conditions,
- strengthens coverage continuity,
- reduces reliance on subsidies,
- and simplifies enforcement.

This is not a repeal.

It is a completion.

---

## The core idea

Healthcare works best when the foundation is simple, universal, and boring.

Competition belongs **above** that foundation — not underneath it.

The Backbone provides:

- security without rigidity,
- choice without chaos,
- affordability without fragility.

---

## What comes next

With a Backbone in place, we can finally answer practical questions honestly:

- How do costs actually come down?
- How do rural hospitals survive?
- How do patients gain real security?
- How does private insurance compete fairly?

Those answers come next — not as theory, but as outcomes.
