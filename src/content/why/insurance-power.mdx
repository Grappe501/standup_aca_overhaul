title: How Insurance Companies Hold Power
description: Why insurance companies, not doctors or patients, control healthcare — and why real reform has to confront that power.

## The short version (2–3 minutes)

Insurance companies do not control healthcare because they are better at delivering care.

They control it because:

- the rules favor them,
- complexity protects them,
- and there is no strong alternative to keep them honest.

The Affordable Care Act regulated some of their worst behavior — but it did not remove their control over the system.

If we want lower costs, reliable access to care, and real security, that has to change.

## What insurance is supposed to do — and what it actually does

In theory, insurance exists to:

- spread risk across large groups,
- guarantee access to necessary care,
- protect people from financial catastrophe.

In practice, most private insurance companies focus on:

- managing payouts,
- avoiding high-cost patients,
- delaying care,
- shifting costs onto patients and providers,
- and designing plans that look affordable but aren’t.

This is not because insurers are uniquely bad actors.

It is because the system **rewards** this behavior.

## How power works in modern healthcare

Insurance companies sit at the center of the system. They do not just pay bills — they shape the rules everyone else must follow.

That power shows up in several predictable ways.

---

## Power mechanism #1: Control over plan design

Insurance companies decide:

- what services are covered,
- when they are covered,
- how much you must pay before coverage kicks in,
- which doctors and hospitals count,
- and what hoops must be jumped through first.

Two plans can charge the same premium and deliver wildly different real-world value.

This allows insurers to:

- attract healthier enrollees,
- discourage people who need care,
- advertise low prices while hiding future costs.

The ACA tried to standardize plans — but not enough to prevent this kind of gaming.

---

## Power mechanism #2: Prior authorization and delay

One of the strongest tools insurers use is **delay**.

Prior authorization allows insurers to:

- require approval before care is provided,
- deny first and force appeals,
- exhaust providers and patients,
- quietly reduce utilization.

This shifts decision-making power:

- away from doctors,
- away from patients,
- toward insurance administrators.

Delays save money — even when care is eventually approved.

---

## Power mechanism #3: Narrow networks

Insurers often limit which doctors and hospitals are considered “in network.”

This allows them to:

- negotiate lower payments,
- avoid expensive providers,
- shift unexpected costs onto patients.

For patients, this often means:

- fewer choices,
- longer travel times,
- surprise bills,
- fragmented care.

Narrow networks are frequently invisible until care is needed — when it is too late to change plans.

---

## Power mechanism #4: Churn as a business model

People regularly move between:

- Medicaid,
- Marketplace plans,
- employer coverage,
- and uninsured status.

This is called **churn**.

Churn benefits insurers because:

- long-term health outcomes do not matter,
- high-cost patients often leave,
- care coordination becomes unnecessary,
- accountability disappears.

When coverage is unstable, insurers do not have to invest in people’s health.

---

## Power mechanism #5: Complexity as protection

Healthcare in the United States is confusing by design.

Complexity:

- discourages comparison shopping,
- overwhelms patients,
- hides responsibility,
- limits public accountability.

The more confusing the system is, the harder it is to regulate — and the easier it is to defend the status quo.

Confusion is not accidental.

It is **structural protection**.

---

## Power mechanism #6: Weak competition

In many markets, people have:

- one or two insurers to choose from,
- no meaningful alternative,
- no public option to fall back on.

That is not a market.

That is managed dependence.

Without a credible baseline option:

- insurers set the terms,
- prices drift upward,
- consumers absorb the risk.

---

## Why the ACA didn’t break this power

The Affordable Care Act:

- banned discrimination against sick people,
- required minimum benefit standards,
- expanded subsidies,
- regulated some pricing behavior.

But it still:

- relied on private insurers to run the system,
- subsidized high prices rather than lowering them,
- allowed plan complexity to persist,
- left no universal fallback option.

In short:

The ACA regulated insurance companies — but it did not replace their dominance.

---

## Why this matters for cost, access, and stability

As long as insurers control:

- plan design,
- access rules,
- reimbursement dynamics,
- and administrative complexity,

Costs will rise — no matter how many subsidies exist.

Subsidies help people afford a broken system.

They do not fix the system.

---

## The core insight

If insurance companies remain the central organizing force of healthcare, then:

- care will be delayed,
- costs will be shifted,
- complexity will grow,
- rural hospitals will struggle,
- and people will remain exposed.

Real reform does **not** require eliminating private insurance.

It requires ending their control over the foundation.

## What comes next

The solution is not more regulation layered on top of a weak structure.

The solution is a new backbone — one that is:

- simple,
- universal,
- fair,
- affordable,
- and strong enough to force honest competition.

That is where this plan goes next.
