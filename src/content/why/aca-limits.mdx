## The short version (2–3 minutes)

The Affordable Care Act made healthcare fairer.

It did not make healthcare stable.

The ACA corrected some of the worst abuses of the old system — but it left the underlying structure intact. As a result, costs continue to rise, care remains fragmented, and access is still fragile.

This is not a failure of intent.

It is a limit of design.

---

## What the ACA successfully fixed

The ACA addressed real and serious problems.

It:

- banned discrimination against people with preexisting conditions,
- required insurers to cover essential benefits,
- expanded Medicaid in many states,
- provided subsidies to make coverage more affordable,
- imposed limits on some pricing abuses.

These changes mattered.

Millions of people gained coverage who would otherwise have been excluded.

---

## What the ACA did not change

The ACA did **not** change who controls the system.

It:

- kept private insurance companies at the center,
- relied on plan complexity to manage costs,
- subsidized premiums rather than restructuring prices,
- preserved fragmented coverage and churn,
- left no universal fallback option.

The system became more humane — but not more coherent.

---

## Regulation without a new foundation

The ACA attempted to regulate a system that was already structurally unstable.

That meant:

- layering rules on top of complexity,
- managing behavior rather than redesigning incentives,
- correcting outcomes instead of changing inputs.

Over time, regulation became harder to enforce and easier to work around.

The system adapted — without becoming simpler or cheaper.

---

## Why affordability remains fragile

Subsidies lowered premiums for many people.

But they did not:

- reduce administrative overhead,
- simplify billing and payment,
- stabilize provider revenue,
- anchor prices to a public baseline.

As prices rose, subsidies rose with them.

Affordability improved — but cost growth continued unchecked.

---

## Why access remains unstable

Coverage under the ACA is often temporary.

People move between:

- Medicaid,
- Marketplace plans,
- employer coverage,
- uninsured status.

This churn means:

- disrupted care,
- unstable provider funding,
- weak accountability for outcomes.

Access exists — but it is not secure.

---

## Why rural healthcare continued to collapse

The ACA expanded coverage, but it did not stabilize payments.

Rural providers still face:

- high administrative burden,
- unpredictable reimbursement,
- narrow networks,
- delayed payments.

Coverage expansion without structural reform did not reverse rural decline.

In many cases, it slowed collapse — without stopping it.

---

## The central limitation

The ACA assumed that if insurance markets were fairer and better regulated, they would eventually deliver stability.

But fairness is not the same as durability.

A system can be fair — and still fragile.

As long as private insurers control:

- plan design,
- access rules,
- reimbursement dynamics,
- administrative complexity,

the system remains exposed.

---

## The core insight

The ACA proved something important:

Regulation alone cannot fix a system built on the wrong foundation.

To deliver:

- stable access,
- predictable costs,
- resilient providers,
- and long-term security,

healthcare needs more than guardrails.

It needs a backbone.

## What comes next

The next step is not to undo the ACA.

It is to build on what it made possible.

That requires a simple, universal foundation underneath the existing system — one that:

- guarantees baseline coverage,
- anchors prices,
- stabilizes providers,
- and forces honest competition above it.

That foundation is the Backbone.
