## The short version (2–3 minutes)

Healthcare costs in the United States are high — and they keep rising — not because people use too much care.

They rise because the system is designed to:

- shift costs instead of reducing them,
- reward administrative control instead of health outcomes,
- and protect pricing power rather than competition.

Subsidies help people afford this system.

They do not change how the system works.

---

## A common myth about healthcare costs

The most common explanation for rising healthcare costs is simple — and wrong:

> “Healthcare is expensive because people use too much of it.”

In reality:

- Americans do **not** use more care than people in other wealthy countries.
- Outcomes are often worse.
- Administrative costs are dramatically higher.

The problem is not utilization.

The problem is **how the system is organized**.

---

## Where costs actually come from

Healthcare costs rise because money leaks out of the system at every layer.

Not into better care — but into friction.

That friction shows up in several predictable ways.

---

## Cost driver #1: Administrative overhead

The U.S. healthcare system runs on paperwork, billing codes, compliance rules, and insurance-specific processes.

This creates:

- massive billing departments,
- duplicated administrative staff,
- endless prior authorization work,
- complex claims disputes.

Hospitals and doctors are forced to build entire parallel systems just to get paid.

Those costs are not optional.

They are baked into prices.

---

## Cost driver #2: Cost shifting, not cost control

When insurers negotiate lower payments in one area, the system does not get cheaper.

Costs are shifted:

- onto patients through deductibles and copays,
- onto employers through premiums,
- onto providers through underpayment,
- onto the public through subsidies and bailouts.

This creates the illusion of savings while total costs continue to rise.

---

## Cost driver #3: Prices divorced from value

In much of U.S. healthcare:

- prices are negotiated in secret,
- the same service can cost wildly different amounts,
- patients cannot meaningfully shop,
- providers cannot predict payment.

There is no stable pricing baseline.

Without one, prices float upward — not because care improves, but because nothing anchors them.

---

## Cost driver #4: Fragmentation and churn

People regularly move between insurance plans and coverage types.

This fragmentation means:

- no long-term investment in health,
- repeated intake and onboarding costs,
- duplicated tests and visits,
- broken care coordination.

Short-term coverage creates short-term thinking.

Short-term thinking creates higher costs.

---

## Cost driver #5: Delay as a savings strategy

Delaying care saves money — at least on paper.

Prior authorization, step therapy, and appeals:

- reduce immediate utilization,
- discourage follow-through,
- push people out of care entirely.

But delayed care often becomes **more expensive care later**.

The system saves money today by spending more tomorrow.

---

## Why subsidies don’t stop cost growth

Subsidies help people pay premiums.

They do **not**:

- reduce administrative overhead,
- simplify pricing,
- stabilize care,
- or change who controls the system.

As long as subsidies chase rising prices instead of restructuring the system, costs will continue to grow.

Public money absorbs private inefficiency.

---

## The connection to rural hospitals and access

Rising costs do not affect all communities equally.

In rural areas:

- margins are thin,
- patient volumes are lower,
- administrative burden is crushing.

When costs rise without structural reform:

- rural hospitals close,
- services disappear,
- travel distances increase,
- communities lose care entirely.

Cost growth is not abstract.

It reshapes who gets care and who does not.

---

## The core insight

Healthcare costs rise because the system is designed to **manage money**, not health.

As long as:

- insurers control access,
- pricing lacks a stable baseline,
- complexity replaces competition,

Costs will rise — regardless of how much public money is spent.

---

## What comes next

Lowering costs does not require cutting care.

It requires changing the structure that produces waste, delay, and instability.

That means confronting:

- who sets the rules,
- how prices are anchored,
- and what happens when the system fails.

Next, we look at how this cost structure is breaking rural healthcare — and why entire communities are losing access to care.
