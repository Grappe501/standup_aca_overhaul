## The short version (2–3 minutes)

Healthcare costs come down when the system stops paying for friction.

The Backbone lowers costs by:

- removing redundant administration,
- stabilizing prices with a public baseline,
- reducing delays and denials,
- and ending cost shifting as a business model.

This is not about paying doctors less or rationing care.

It is about changing how the system is organized.

---

## Cost reduction is structural, not behavioral

Most cost-control efforts focus on behavior:

- asking patients to shop,
- asking doctors to do more paperwork,
- asking regulators to chase bad actors.

The Backbone changes structure instead.

When structure changes, behavior follows automatically.

---

## Mechanism #1: Administrative simplification

A large share of U.S. healthcare spending goes to administration — not care.

The Backbone reduces administrative costs by:

- replacing dozens of plan-specific rules with a single baseline,
- eliminating duplicative billing systems,
- reducing prior authorization requirements,
- standardizing payment processes.

Hospitals and clinics no longer need parallel systems to navigate every insurer’s rules.

That savings is permanent.

---

## Mechanism #2: A stable pricing anchor

Today, prices float because there is no baseline.

Under the Backbone:

- essential services are paid according to clear, public rules,
- prices are predictable,
- extreme variation is reduced,
- negotiations happen above a known floor.

Private plans can still negotiate — but they do so against a stable reference point.

This pulls prices down over time without blunt caps.

---

## Mechanism #3: Fewer delays, fewer denials

Delays and denials save money on paper — but they raise total costs.

The Backbone reduces costs by:

- minimizing prior authorization for baseline care,
- paying providers predictably,
- reducing appeals and resubmissions,
- keeping people in continuous care.

Care delivered on time is almost always cheaper than care delayed.

---

## Mechanism #4: Ending cost shifting

Today, when insurers lower payments in one area, costs are pushed elsewhere.

The Backbone stops this by:

- stabilizing baseline reimbursement,
- reducing surprise billing,
- limiting the need to offset losses through higher prices,
- aligning payment with actual care delivery.

When costs are controlled at the foundation, they do not reappear elsewhere.

---

## Mechanism #5: Reducing churn-driven waste

Coverage instability forces the system to restart over and over.

The Backbone:

- guarantees continuous baseline coverage,
- eliminates repeated onboarding and intake costs,
- reduces duplicated testing and visits,
- supports long-term care planning.

Stability is cheaper than constant reset.

---

## What does *not* drive these savings

Costs do **not** come down because:

- patients are denied care,
- doctors are paid less for the same work,
- care is rationed,
- or people are forced into narrow networks.

The savings come from removing waste, not squeezing care.

---

## Why subsidies become smaller — and smarter

When prices are anchored and administration is simpler:

- premiums fall naturally,
- subsidies do not have to chase rising costs,
- public spending becomes more predictable.

The system needs **less rescue money** because it breaks less often.

---

## The core insight

Healthcare costs are high because the system pays for complexity, instability, and delay.

The Backbone removes those features at the foundation.

When friction disappears, costs follow.

---

## What comes next

Lower costs are only meaningful if care is available everywhere.

Next, we look at how the Backbone stabilizes rural healthcare — and why access stops depending on geography.
